    "summary": "Soon-to-be MA graduate in Global Political Economy and Global Conflict. Currently looking for an occupation in the field of Policy Research and Advocacy. I believe that research is the first step to promoting society's well-being, sustainable development and equality. After four years of academic training and 2 years of professional experience, I am eager to put my skills to work and help save our planet and global society!\n\nI bring 1 year of experience in the field of (Academic) Consultancy for international organisations and government agencies, such as WTO and the UWV governmental agency in the Netherlands. \nI have overseen and contributed to research dedicated to levelling the engagement and connection of stakeholders from diverse cultural backgrounds, and I have also managed time schedules, social events, and presentations for the teams under my supervision. These experiences have been crucial in the consolidation of my policy analysis competencies.\n\nI have an additional year of experience in the field of event management for one of my university\u2019s student associations (BASIS). My position as External Affairs Officer enabled me to gain valuable experience in team collaboration, drafting of events plans and managing communication with external parties to the association.\nOverall, since 2021 I have managed and contributed to teams ranging from five to fourteen members. I can safely state that I have always distinguished myself in the roles covered. \nI believe my success is based on team building, open collaboration, listening to clients and partner organisations, addressing conflicts as they arise and ensuring the quality and timeliness of the products at every step of the project. \n\nI'm a highly motivated and ambitious young professional. I have a natural predisposition for competitiveness and a profound love for challenges, but I strongly believe in the value of collaboration and empathy towards others. I am dedicated, knowledge-hungry and always strive for perfection. If I had to highlight five qualities I most often receive in feedback, these would be teamwork, leadership, good communication, proactiveness and analytical thinking.\n\nFluent proficiency in English, Spanish and Italian - trying to reach the same goal with Russian and French.",
