    "summary": "Hi, I'm Isla - I'm passionate about fitness and wellness, good food, and new experiences and enjoy fostering connections and building relationships.\n\nAs a People Manager, I am the go-to person for our international IT professionals. I build strong relationships with professionals and clients, helping to optimize performance within various projects, to ensure the best experience with our organization. My experience as a Recruiter and Spinning Instructor, along with my strong background in psychology give me a unique perspective on how to effectively connect with people. With a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a Master's in Sport Psychology, I bring a well-rounded understanding of human behavior to my work. I am highly skilled in communication and organization, which allows me to effectively manage my workload and collaborate with team members.\n\nMy international experience living in Hong Kong, Canada, and the Netherlands has given me a global perspective and the ability to adapt quickly to diverse environments. In my spare time, you can find me lifting at the gym or on the bike at spin class.\n\n\u2709\ufe0f i.littlewood@levy-professionals.com",
