    "summary": "Having successfully played many roles in IT, at heart I'm still an engineer.\n\nI'm quite flexible in the position or role I can do, be it Software Architect, .Net Software Engineer or React Web Developer. In all those roles, I try to analyse and improve software systems, business processes and the process of creating software. As I'm an experienced modern software architect and have extensive architecture knowledge, that I use to help agile teams build better software. I like to communicate an inspiring vision of the future and supporting people along the way.\n\nEvery system has an architecture, but a good design with e.g. Domain Driven Development (DDD) with Microservices can avoid a lot of pitfalls. Modelling the business logic with UML gives insight to engineers, simplifying development and avoid accidents for new hires. While it can also enable performance and mitigate the fallout of accidents.\n\nMy experience with processes such as Kanban and Scrum, architectures such as Microservices, SOA and the layer model, methods such as TDD and BDD, principles such as SOLID, IoC, KISS, DRY, YAGNI and SoC (Separation of Concerns) and patterns such as the Design Patterns and GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) mean that I can participate in any development team and that in many cases I can take the team to a higher level.\n\nFor 2 decades I have specialize in .NET development. The ever improving framework makes a solid foundation for any application. The reach it has makes it easy to integrate many aspects of development. It was open from the start, so I have been able to use open source solutions where they fit. Therefor I have branched out to things like ReactJS, Kafka, RabbidMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker and Kubernetes to name a few.\n\nAfter decades of keeping tabs on what is current in IT and having a passion for learning combined with a wide range of interests, I have gained extensive knowledge in many field, like coding, psychology, design and management. This means that I can settle in quickly and can also offer added value in less clearly defined roles.",

This time I'm developing a IOT application to track the shovels in the harbor picking up ore and dumping it in funnels. It's an innovative project to prohibit mistakes and optimize workflow. \nTechnically the shovel is tracked with GPS. It's position and state are communicated over 4G to Azure IOT and Azure Functions, then further to on premise servers. Assignments are created in an Aurelia Single Page Application (SPA) and flow the other way. They are made visible on an embedded tablet on the shovel with UWP/WinUI3. The REST services, forming the core of the system, are state of the art .Net with things like MediatR and FluentValidations. The Scrum process is supported by Azure DevOps with full CI/CD.\nLots of research hurdles to take and we had some force majeure technical setbacks. Luckily, we have a great team and other departments are supporting us, so we're making progress, nevertheless. \nIt looks like this project is a showcase for the technical prowess of Tata Steel. It coincides with the other ingenious project of using hydrogen to make steel. In my mind this is an essential project for the future of the company as a mayor benefactor to the region, the future of European industry as an integrated system and the future of the world as an ecology. My contribution to that greater goal, however little, is something I value and I'm glad I can do my part.",

In the front-end of the websites there is a need for a rebuild, after they have been adapted and maintained for 15 years. Als the move to the, in NL less known, Norwegian CMS Enonic has had an impact. The CMS has excellent scalability and streamlines web publishing. It runs on top of ElasticSearch and Hazelcast, is written in Java and has the capability to compile JavaScript to Java with PurlpleJS. This makes it very fast, although somewhat quirky to work with.\nI have worked as part of the Scrum team, mainly focusing on research for the next version of the front-end websites. GraphQL, ReactJS/Next.js, WebPack, Typescript and TailwindCSS have been incorporated into the architecture, as well as unit testing with Jest and code guidelines adherence with Pretty among other things. I have created a Proof of Concept, a Component library and lots of documentation. The team should have a flying start, when they start with the rebuild.\nPersonally, after decades of Microsoft C# .Net, the Java world has been an interesting change of scenery. I've always been independent of MS and very much involved with the general crafting of software, so there are many synergies, although lots of details work differently than expected. As a bonus, the team and company culture are a great match. As they say \"Winnen do je bij de Postcode Loterij\".",

Unfortunately I did contract Covid in march and it was nasty. Luckily no hospital was needed, although it was close. The aftermath took longer then I expected, as I couldn't smell anything for a month and even worse, I was dead tired for multiple months. After recuperating it was my mother who went ill. I don't feel free to tell the details, but suffice to say that cancer is a serious illness made worse during a pandemic. \nThe initial hysteria of Covid made going back to a job less attractive. Also I value real world team interaction and a physical Kanban board, over remote work. Now I feel that the hysteria has passed and remote work has improved technically and more importantly socially.\n\nDuring my sabbatical I created Fountain Exponential and Open Game Asset Structure. These are both projects that aim to improve fundamental aspects of game development. The technologies from these projects are intended to be integrated into multiple game engines, to make dialog and other assets reusable between game engines.\nTo publish my findings I'm working on a number of articles. They will be in essay format to make it easy to adopt and explain. Back in 2000 I basically created the Entity Component System (ECS), but only published it as my Engineering degree paper and not in the trades. I left game development disillusioned because of the lack of professionalism. In 2006 ECS was presented by somebody else at a game trade show. It remained a promising architecture without making any inroads, but now ECS is going mainstream with Unity ECS. In 2000 I did the community a disservice not to stand by what I created and aim to do better now.\nThe first of the essay's is attached below.",

My role as co-founder and IT-Manager was, because of the size of the team, more hands on then managerial, although I did a lot of business development, coaching and instructing. The technical side of the business was my responsibility, as my co-founder handled the marketing and administration. We tried to create a cutting edge solution for the leasing industry, where we used all the leading technologies and tried to better understand our customers, in order to deliver a superior product. Unfortunately this created a perfect storm, of a paradigm shift to functional programming in the front-end, distributed computing in the back-end, containers for infrastructure and the complex domain logic of the aircraft industry plus high finance. Technical, the thing that did me in, was the issue of putting inherently relational data in a document database. Switching from Redis to PostgreSQL was going to solve it, but it also surfaced the differences between the founders. Perceiving the context as being in different Cynefin domains, lead to different behaviors or Hanlon's razor combined with the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect applies. Either way, with the outlook on the market changed, I lost confidence in the company being a good investment.\n\nFor the analysis of the domain I used Domain Driven Design (DDD), designing a micro-service architecture with CQRS and event-sourcing, describing the architecture in ao UML, taking special care for the aspects of ergonomy, consistency and security. The used technologies, Asp.net core, React-Redux, Webpack, Lodash, Bootstrap, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Logstash(ELK), Docker, Kubernetes needed extensive research. The implementation was mainly done in Typescript for the single page application (SPA), C# for the back-end RESTfull WebApi plus consumers and Powershell for the infrastructure. We used Azure DevOps Services (TFS) for our Scrum development process and DevOps integration.",

The design I made and helped implement involved administrating and pricing the resources in such a way that the calculations could be traced back to there origin, similar to accounting.\n\nAfter the initial project I stayed on to help with making the in house framework unit an intigration testable, coach multiple junior programmers as well as interns, replaced JIRA with Team Foundation Server (TFS) to support the scrum process, added  Continues Integration (CI) & Continues Deployment (CD) with an OTAP street using Powershell. The CI/CD included back-copying and anonymising the production data to be able to refresh the development SqlServer databases. \nThe preexisting micro-service architecture based on RabbitMQ was extended among other things with integration with the servicedesk tool ServiceNow, the customer  self service portal build in Asp.net MVC/knockout, the VMware virtual machine management, the Veeam back-up solutions and the Logstash (ELK stack) logging.

Similarly companies in high end nieces involving costly resources like aircraft's and ships with highly complex \u201ctailor made\u201d leases could also benefit by reducing their \"Transaction costs\".\n\nModern customers are only interested in use of assets and less in ownership. Ownership is seen as a burden instead of status, because of financing, insurance, maintenance, and finally reselling. Leasing takes care of all these areas for the customer, by banking, insuring, managing and mediating. All this makes leasing one of the most complex financial products there are.

I realized that, if I started a job without changing anything, I would have the same results, Because the results of before, simply weren't enough, I changed a lot of things,\n\nI become more credible by having a more business like look and style.\nI improved my mental aptitude by studying zen and doing mental exercise.\nI enhanced my physical condition by going for a run at 5  o'clock in the morning and going to the gym in the afternoon.\nI improved my availability by finishing the mayor renovation of my house. \nIn order to be of better service to a business I read up on economics and management theory.\nI deepened my architecture knowledge by studying TOGAF, and SOA.\nI solidified my development skills by going for .NET certifications, like ASP.NET and Entity Framework.\nI improved my knowledge of the development process by studying agile methods like Scrum and TDD.",

Unfortunately going solo took a lot of effort and money and reinventing the company in the middle of the crisis was too much. The left overs where picket up by the Braincap group, witch they had cooperated with and where shareholders. \nI personally think they had a much better partner in Ordina, as those where trustworthy and whole lot less sly.\nI think trust is the basis for any business and therefor would not take the deal Braincap offered me. I hold no grudge over what happened at Integer and Braincap. What they did was probably the smartest thing to do and largely dictated by circumstance. I wish all the people at Braincap all the best. So long and thanks for the fish.",
