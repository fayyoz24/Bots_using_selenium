English is Guyana's national language so I was not required to just teach English but instead teach all primary school subjects - Mathematics, English, Science,Social Studies, Art and Music.\n\nI also helped out in the kitchen and office of the Eco-lodge I was staying in. This meant helping the kitchen staff make the evening meals for the other guests as well as helping to set up a new website for the eco-lodge.\n\nThis was such an incredible experience and really made me appreciate my own education and how luck I am to live in Australia and to have been able to go to not only primary school, but high school and university. \n\nI definitely recommend this company for a unique, life changing volunteering experience!\n\nhttp://fronteering.com/"
