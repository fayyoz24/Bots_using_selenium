    "summary": "Charitomeni was born on the 8th of June 1998 in Athens, Greece and raised in Rhodes Island in the Mediterranean Sea. Motivated by her interest in science and excited by the thought of getting her hands on it, in 2016 she decided to study Chemistry at the University of Crete. She was awarded with the Bachelor of Chemistry in 2020. In her fourth year as an undergraduate student, she completed a Bachelor\u2019s Thesis in the Division of Organic Chemistry. Driven by her eager of learning and wanted to expands her knowledge also in the field of Biochemistry, in 2020 she pursued a master\u2019s degree at the University of Crete, that combined biotechnology and photochemistry. Upon her successful completion of her Master\u2019s degree on March 2023, and captivated by the \u201cLaboratory Environment\u201d, she decided to start her PhD at the Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy (GRIP) at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. In her project, the main goal is to expand the scope of nitrogen-nitrogen-bond forming enzymes.",
