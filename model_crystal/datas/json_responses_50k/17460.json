    "summary": "How can we help each other keep up with all the changes in this highly rapid changing world? And how can we stimulate each other to keep learning and helping each other? This is something I like to contribute to with drive, energy, enthusiasm, and optimism. \n\nOne of my biggest passions is sports. I think it shares many similarities with our working lives. I\u2019ve always played hockey on National and International level and I\u2019m probably one of the most competitive individuals you will ever meet. I\u2019ve learned so many things from sport. Efficiency, through combining training with education, but also that by trusting each other and using every person\u2019s unique qualities, beautiful outcomes will follow! In sport, you can work towards a common goal with a team, stimulate each other and learn from the good and the bad moments along the journey. \n\nAfter my studies in Communication, I worked at a startup for mobile ordering and paying and Microsoft. I love tech companies due to the stimulating and fast changing environment in which people are motivated to develop innovative and life changing products and services every day, in a fast way. With my love for change management, people and building culture, I moved to HEINEKEN and worked on several transformation projects. Either during my job or in my daily life I like to meet and connect with people and build a welcoming and open work culture in which people feel a sense of belonging.\n\nI\u2019m focused on Change Management (strategy & implementation), Corporate Branding, Communication and building a culture of true belonging.",
