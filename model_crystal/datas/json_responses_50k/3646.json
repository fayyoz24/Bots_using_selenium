With a serious business game clients will get more insights in the business strategies that are most valuable for implementing a new product. In our case we picked Essent as our client to implement green energy, by the use of compost toilets, in Nigeria. It was a challenging project and a very exciting group process. On the basis of the criteria creativity, professionalism, methods (among others; systems analyses, strategy tables and scenarios) we were awarded with a 9 out of 10 for our project. In January 2014 we were invited to present our idea to BoP Innovation Center. ",
