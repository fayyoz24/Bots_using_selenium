    "summary": "I am a political scientist with a focus on international relations and conflict research. I currently serve as the academic program director for the new B.Sc. Global Studies offered collaboratively by all faculties of Maastricht University. Since 2017, I have contributed to the development of Global Studies, taking a leading role in the successful macro-efficiency application in 2018 and initial accreditation in 2019.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2018, I have served as the education director for the M.Sc. program in Public Policy and Human Development. I have taken a leading role in converting this program into one of the first master degrees offered by the United Nations University, contributed to the launch of several specialization tracks and led the effort for reaccreditation as a joint degree with Maastricht University.\n\nHaving completed graduate degrees in economics, political science and humanitarian assistance, my studies focus on the impact of democratization processes on the likelihood of civil-war onset in ethnically heterogeneous countries as part of the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research \"Challenges to Democracy in the 21st Century\". I have collaborated in the development of a new coding method for democratization periods and contributed to the launch of the peer-reviewed journal Living Reviews in Democracy. For my dissertation at ETH Zurich, I have investigated the influence of political leaders on the likelihood of civil-war onset during democratization phases, challenging the theory of \"elite manipulation\" on the grounds that the theorized extensive influence of political leaders is unrealistic. As part of my second research focus, I have published an edited volume of student studies on the functioning of actors in the global civil society.\n\nI continue to lecture at the School of Business & Economics and University College at Maastricht University and provide supervision and academic advising for bachelor, master and doctoral students.",
