Replacing all the Mac OS X servers with Windows AD controllers, replacing our backup software suite to match, new RAID management, and working with our existing SANS hardware, will bring our IT systems out of a mixed environment with limited functionality into a full suite of industry standard tools, software, and hardware. This also presents us the opportunity to have a common hardware platform for our clients, which enables us to set up very rapid network disaster recovery on our clients as well as our servers.",

Successfully implemented a full-featured and robust OpenStack private cloud. This required integrating a private cloud with an existing infrastructure landscape that has been built up over thirty years, and has seen a plethora of organizational shuffles and with a myriad of procedural overhead. This started my championing and advocating for a hybrid cloud model for Rabobank, and started educating and extolling the benefits of Infrastructure as a Service, Infrastructure as Code, DevOps principles and values, radical automation, containerization, kubernetes, and all things agile and DevOps.",
