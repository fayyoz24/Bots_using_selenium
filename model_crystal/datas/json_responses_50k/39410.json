The other competitors were JCFO, SWA and TCL. The jury praised the winning proposal for its fresh approach and being highly attentive to local ecology meanwhile incorporating romantic techniques and realistic urban functions. \n\nThe forest and sports park is to become a destination for the Big Bay area. As this metropolitan region finds its success in innovative industries, the park focuses on innovation in sports and ecology. Two R&D centers, one for sports, one for botany are centrally located in the park. From here, a constant evolution and diversification of the park will take place. On the central park loop, a linear plant and tree nursery is integrated. In a natural forest setting, people will be able to get to know new and forgotten sports, as well as the latest techniques used in sports. A range from open valleys to lower hills and mountain forest offers the natural background for these sports and active leisure. \n\nAn elevated path connects the park to the city and the forest; forming a scenic route that passes by all different types of forest. A series of pavilions, that host functions like restaurant, restroom, viewing platform and forest cabin, is modular an prefabricated, to minimize environmental impact. ",

The river and the treasures along it\nhave been hibernating in segregation, fragmentation and neglect. We are ready to bring the river back to the people.

Being part of a UNESCO heritage area, it is surrounded by numerous historical monuments. In our design proposal the park is the connector of all these sites, binding the Red Square to the Green Square Saint Elias and both to the river. \nOur aim is to create a timeless park which has great value for centuries to come; a park that enhances the existing heritage rather than competing with it; a park that is informal and dynamic adapting to future trends, rather than trendy and hip for a short while. \nOpen spaces of different sizes and atmospheres are created. They allow for multiple park activities ranging from big public events to small intimate meetings. A wide variety of tree species, not only naturally encourages bio-diversity, but also brings seasonal highlights throughout the year, with a spectacle of colors from spring to autumn.\nThe existing sloping landscape is transformed into four terraced levels, each level baring its own character and activity. \nNew built facilities are located along a big ring serving as a simple and comfortable walking route, and integrated into the terraced landscape. \nCurrently the park and the river are separated from each other by a six-lane road. In our design, we offer a wide passage under the road to a new grand waterfront venue. The building along the road serves as an anti-noise barrier for the park and creates a \"belvedere\" overlooking the River Moskva.",

The basic objective of the Groene Singel project is to transform this strategic area, which today is underutilized, fragmented and marginal, into a new centrality of the city. In addition to open and green spaces, the area of the Groene Singel provides important building programs.\nAfter a thorough selection process in January 2012, Maxwan in collaboration with Karres and Brands HUB and Goudappel Coffeng were appointed by the city planning authorities of Antwerp to develop design guidelines (BKP) for the \u2018Strategic Space Groene Singel\u2019. The plan describes the rules for landscapes, public spaces, infrastructures and buildings and defines sub-projects, which proactively will improve the image quality of the area. In addition, it is a handbook of guidelines for designers.\nThe formulated guidelines suit scale and complexity of the space of the Green Singel. They propose strategies taking into account current planning processes and limited resources of the client. The green of the Groene Singel is the driving constant of the plan: the creation of a powerful coherent ecological system by linking five major urban parks. Three different landscapes are developed into strong units of high visual quality. Throughout these three landscapes linear structures with a uniform image quality lie across the entire length of the Singel. Against the backdrop of the constants of landscape and infrastructure special buildings and outdoor areas are situated. ",

It is one of the seven priority projects designated by the Flemish government to exemplify excellence in urban development in the coming years. It will be a three phase design and execution project, reconnecting central station and the main market square via an over 1km pedestrian boulevard.\nThe vision is to form a true central city axis, seamlessly integrating the various streets, knitting together the five major squares, and all the while maximizing space for green, water, bikes, and art. Pedestrian space is paramount, enlivening the shopping experience. The materials choice is envisioned to be simple, providing comfort and quality, allowing the users to be the highlight of the space. \nIt will be a place to live, play, shop and stroll. This city gateway will reconnect Mechelen with its rich history and fulfill its ambition of becoming the most significant shopping boulevard in Flanders.",
