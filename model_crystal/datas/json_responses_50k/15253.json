    "summary": "I am the founder, since 2012, of WATERWYS, where I continue my profession in the water sector. I am a firm believer of integrated water resources management as a framework for regional planning and its enabling role in the environmental and economic development sectors of society. My interests have an international focus, recognising the importance of institution and capacity building to maximise sustainability in our interventions for development with focus on the challenges presented by the international water, food and energy nexus.\n\nI have a professional career of 52 years as a civil engineer in hydrology, geo-hydrology and water management. I have 20 years of resident overseas experience in America, Africa and Asia, and 27 years of resident experience in The Netherlands, working for international organisations and for leading Dutch research organisations TNO and Deltares. My work has included both content and line management including project management and supervision, institution building, knowledge transfer and capacity building. More recently my work has focused on the technical assistance preceding, during and in the aftermath of water-related disasters. I am one of a pool of team leaders of the  DRR (Dutch Risk Reduction) team, an initiative of the Netherlands Government to assist countries facing disasters. My experience allows me to offer strategic technical, institutional and organisational advice to strengthen water resources management and development capacities in organisations and countries.",
