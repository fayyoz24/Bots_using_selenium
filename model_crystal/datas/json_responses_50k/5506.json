Mandemakers Kitchens has since grown into the leading business in the Benelux. At the time, Ben had one main motivation; he had to and would prove that things could be done differently in the kitchen industry. We can now confidently say that he has fully proven that.\n\nQuality and customer-friendliness have always come first at Ben Mandemakers. And of course those two factors were closely followed by competitive prices and a hell of a service. Consumers quickly learned to appreciate Ben's approach.\n\nIn this way, every customer provided beautiful word-of-mouth advertising. The first employees soon arrived; people who were just as fanatic and enthusiastic as Ben himself. And the nice thing is that those same people still work for the company.\n\nDespite the enormous size of his company - there are now eight branches - Ben is still intensively involved in the daily business. For example, he is very keen on the quality of everything he purchases. So critical that the entire procurement is still under his direct responsibility. Fortunately, Ben is now supported by his eldest son Stefan.",
