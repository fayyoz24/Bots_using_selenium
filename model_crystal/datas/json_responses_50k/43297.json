    "summary": "A couple of years ago, I would have never believed I could increase the quality of people's life using math, programming and my creativity.  \n\nI grew up in a family where almost everyone works in healthcare. Improving people's life and well-being were often the main topic of conversation and, early on, caught my interest. After travelling to various countries and living abroad in India, I saw different levels of quality of life and approaches towards improvement. I knew I wanted to focus my professional career on helping people sustainably using my analytical skill. So I decided to do a master Industrial Engineering and Management specializing in Production and Logistic Management. \n\nI have three-year master's experience in operations management, operations research and programming. I applied this experience with my creativity, analytical, problem-solving, programming, and communicative skills while working on various projects. Such as developing a strategic capacity planning model that forecasts future FTE demand in a home care environment based on the inflow of clients and their corresponding care needs. For other projects, see Education-University of Twente and Education-Universidade do Porto. \n\nNow that my studies are ending, I am ready to start writing my next chapter. I am looking for a partly remote/hybrid position in an international environment where I can continue applying operations research, data science and programming with a focus on people, sustainability and creativity. While doing so, I would like to improve and develop myself further in data science and app development.",
