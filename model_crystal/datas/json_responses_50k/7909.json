    "summary": "Rather than solving the symptoms of P2P as they occur, it made perfect sense to look at the whole lifecycle of the process and define a lean and streamlined flow, with limited opportunities for defects and controls to capture the defects as they occur instead of waiting for full blown escalations.\n\nAfter 10 years of working both in the UK and the NL as a P2P troubleshooting expert, focusing primarily on the Accounts payable part, especially helping troubled, in transition or \u201cin-crises\u201d Accounts Payable teams get back to a stable and structured status.\n \nI set up my consultancy firm in 2014 offering a much more robust, structured, process and training led approach to procure-to-pay. It encompasses the full end-to-end lifecycle of the flow by focusing on a seamless process, a stress-free experience for all users within the process, world class queries resolution and a timely payment.\n",
