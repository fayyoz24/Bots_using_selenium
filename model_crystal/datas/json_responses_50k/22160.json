Protein extraction and purification, polyphenol determination and other related techniques were applied to investigate the mechanism of dark brown colour formation during green tea residues (GTR) protein alkaline extraction. After the research, the main element contributed to colour formation was confirmed and possible reactions between protein and polyphenol under alkaline condition were discussed. Moreover, methods to reduce the dark brown colour significantly was developed, leading to an increase of GTR protein application value.",
