    "summary": "Since beginning my career in the design industry, I have thrived in companies that have given me the freedom to develop myself not only as a creative professional, but also to grow at a personal level. I believe that this is something that is important to have throughout my career. \n\nThrough training and research, I have been able to develop my conceptual designing skills, as well as learning new tricks and techniques. Using these skills, I have created, and directed the creation of, many different campaigns in many different mediums for many different audiences.\n\nThrough travel and cultural experiences, I adapt and tweak the tricks and techniques I have learnt and apply these into my creations, adjusting as necessary to suit the targeted audience. It\u2019s a fantastic feeling when you get it right, and it\u2019s also quite addictive.",
