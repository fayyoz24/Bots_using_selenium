Over the next few months, I was able to fully handle the Austrian and Slovenian Markets, both Key Account and Multibrand, on my own. Working closely with the Sales Team and the Sales Manager of the region, I was able to gain much more experience than I could have hoped for within my job responsibilities. After I had taken the Austrian/Slovenian Market over, I was also given the chance to assist and ultimately lead the Swiss Market as well. This, finally, had put all three markets under my care, in regards to all commercial service tasks (customer service and logistics). \n\nTasks:\n-\tEnsuring the complete order fulfillment process, including delivery and providing continuous coordination between our Headquarter and my Region.\n-\tGuaranteeing friendly and professionally interactions between Diesel, all customers and us. This includes building trust within these relationships.\n-\tManaging the customer database for all correspondence, including the up-keep of said database. \n-\tControlling and managing the entire seasonal order book, to ensure a maximum result on deliveries for customers. \n-\tCoordinating all after-sales-activities for existing customers and their databases, in addition to increasing customer satisfaction. \n-\tCollaborating daily with the Sales Representatives and Sales Manager of the regions you are working with.",
