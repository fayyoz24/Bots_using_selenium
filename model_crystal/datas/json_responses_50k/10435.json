    "summary": "Hi! I am Rebecca, I am originally from Ireland and have been living in the Netherlands for the past two years. Building on my bachelor's degree in Commerce from University College Cork and my master's degree in International Business and Management from the University of Groningen, I have experience in the areas of marketing, business development and consulting. I am currently working for an AI SaaS scale up in the Netherlands where I am enjoying the fast paced nature that this environment brings, solving common problems for customers and helping them digitally transform their operations through the use of green technologies.\n\nAreas that excite me include technology, FMCG and sustainability. I am fascinated by how these industries are constantly changing and how they can add significant value to individuals, businesses and soceity. I am also extremely passionate about meeting new people from different cultures, as this allows for creativity and different ways of thinking.\n\nAs a person, I am proactive and a self-learner. I am always seeking opportunities to further improve myself and ways to bring a contribution to greater society. Feel free to connect!",
