All participants were invited to take part in \"study pods\", small study groups with self-assigned facilitators, to stimulate deeper discussion on the weekly course content supported with specific prompts to get the conversation started. \n\nAs course proctor I oversaw the study pod experience with more than 40 study pods, which included weekly drop-in calls for study pod facilitators, in which ideas and feedback were solicited & discussed on topics regarding the course and movement building. This in turn was used to help inform and adapt the course as it was being delivered, as well as future course runs.",
