    "summary": "After 20 years of teaching Business English, I decided to pursue another passion and add to my teacher's toolkit. As of September 2022, I have been a bachelor student of Archaeology at Leiden University. I am a keen learner and I am passionate about returning to teaching, once I have finished my new degree.\n\nAbout teaching English: as an experienced teacher (20 yrs+) I enjoy both one-on-one sessions and groups. My skills include a broad knowledge of both general and business English combined with care and sensitivity to all different kinds of learners. I started a joint venture with my husband Evan Dorrestein in January 2008.\n\nSpecialties: General and Business English focussed on intercultural communication skills, Human Resources, banking, accountancy and chemistry.",
