Main results:\n\u2022 Drove development process from Feasibility phase to Concept phase up to Basic Engineering phase for the Pacific Ocean System. Devised a different, more feasible, mobile concept to replace the initial fixed idea: Plastic capturing efficiency 80x larger. Development time 3x shorter. Expected CAPEX and OPEX 5x lower. \n\u2022 Change had major positive impact on company\u2019s prospects. Resulted in 21mln euro new funding within 2 months of the change.
