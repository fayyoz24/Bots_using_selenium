We have a preorder food app for restaurants where people can order their food in advance, so when they arrive their food is ready and paid for.  Our focus is to achieve work life balance through mental and physical well being.  \n\nWe would love to see Noodle supporting employees across every kind of organisation in London and then throughout the UK, as our motto is to achieve healthy communities at our workplaces by reducing stress and anxiety, which something as simple as a proper break with a nutritious meal can accomplish. Additionally, the part that the employer plays in this by making the app available and hosting talks and creating awareness to its workers goes a long way in making them feel appreciated, valued and cared for. In the larger scheme of things for Noodle, I hope to take lunch breaks as a starting off point from which to expand into a variety of strategies to improve employees' health and wellbeing at work, and step by step, to bring positive change.\n\nwww.noodle-app.io",
