    "summary": "I am a Mechanical Engineer with +13 years of experience in technical sales of pumps and rotating equipment, specialized in the development of new businesses through innovation with new and conventional technologies, appropriate equipment selection in complex applications such as: Multiphase pumping in the Oil & Gas industry, handling of acids or dangerous fluids in the chemical industry, sludge treatment in sewage treatment plants and others. Likewise, I have led multidisciplinary teams that have created strategies, designed, manufactured, tested and sold comprehensive solutions tailored to the customer's needs, including automated operation with a frequency inverter, instrumentation and other elements that allow the automation of processes.\n\nIn  the Oil & Gas  and industrial sector I have accumulated during these years, experience in the management of equipment projects manufactured under the standards ANSI B73.1 (Industrial centrifugal pumps for industrial processes), ANSI B73.3 (Centrifugal pumps with magnetic coupling) , API 610 (Centrifugal Pumps for the Oil Industry), API 676 (Screw Pumps), API 674 (Piston Pumps), API 675 (Double Diaphragm Metering Pumps), API 682 (Mechanical Seals), IEEE841 (Electric Motors), API 618 (Reciprocating Compressors) and others. \n\nIn addition, I have gained strategic business knowledge through an MBA (Master of Business Administration) program, which I have put into practice in companies and manufacturers that sell pumps and rotating equipment, together with the management of projects in more than 10 countries and factory training with more than 10 internationally recognized European and American suppliers. All this hands-on experience has given me the necessary skills set to successfully gain market share and grow the pump business.",
