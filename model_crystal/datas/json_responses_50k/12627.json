    "summary": "Growing up as a \"normal\" kid in a traditional Chinese family, deeper in Zippo's mind, he always wanted to be \"different\". But through what?\n\nZippo fell in love with magic when he was a little kid. However it was only until 2009 when he saw the famous Chinese magician Lu Chen performed on TV did he start to take it seriously. He began with close-up magic and from 2011 stage magic, specialised in manipulation. He practiced hard to emulate top magicians around the world. Step by step, he saw magic as a way to be \"different\".\n\nThen Zippo started to think how to differentiate himself with other magicians. So from 2015, he started dance training and developed his own style \u2013 combining contemporary dance with magic.\n\nThe \"normal\" way continues, while the inner voice never fades. Zippo came to the Netherlands and started his Master education in Delft University of Technology in 2015. Since 2016, Zippo has been coached by Ger Copper , previous World Champion of Magic, founder of \"Dutch School of Magic\" together with other team members. Zippo was titled \"Dutch Champion of manipulation\" in 2019 and he also won prizes in France, Belgium and Austria.\n\nIn 2021, Zippo quited his job from an international engineering company, and started mime study in the Amsterdam University of Arts, to pursue his career as an artist.",
