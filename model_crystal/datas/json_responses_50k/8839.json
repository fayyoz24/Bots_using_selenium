Within this triangle, Stenden would closely cooperate with the major municipalities in Southeast Drenthe (Emmen and Hoogeveen) and local entrepreneurs. \n\nI was asked, based on 10 years' experience in Vietnam, whether I would be interested in helping to set up the connection with Vietnam. I agreed and the Southeast Drenthe - Vietnam link has been established successfully.\nThe School of Commerce decided to establish a steering committee, which would form the backbone of the project. Its responsibility is to give direction and structure to the project. The participants are from: Stenden University, Alfa College, the municipalities of Emmen and Hoogeveen and local entrepreneurs.\nThe composition of the committee is such that there is more or less a proportional representation of the three participating parties. This kind of cooperation between municipalities, entrepreneurs and educational institutions may be called the \u2018Triple Helix\u2019 model and the cooperation is one of the keys to this project\u2019s success. Stenden took the initiative for the project, next the municipalities decided to act as facilitators and the local entrepreneurs were invited to participate in jointly organized seminars on doing business in Vietnam and trade missions to selected regions with the aim of setting up business and partnerships with Vietnamese counterparts. Vietnamese businessmen are persuaded to come and visit the region here to establish themselves or seek partnerships in our region.",
