The PSA consists of Carbon Molecular Sieves (CMS) that are responsible for the separation of Nitrogen from remaining air molecules based on their relative size. The specialty of our system is about using simple electronic timers to actuate eight solenoid controlled gate valves. The applications of our product include the extraction of water from humid air and its storage for future use, separation of nitrogen for fire extinguishing purpose, food packaging, purging etc. The oxygen can be used for creating an oxygen- enriched atmosphere at enclosed spaces like offices and homes, when required during the phase of Covid-19.",

Worked in the Process and the Plant Manufacturing Works department, for a duration of 4 weeks. Got to understand the processes that were involved in small LINIT plants and large Air Separation Units. Observed the manufacturing processes that were involved in the fabrication of different cryogenic vessels. Performed activities involving TIG Welding. Got exposure to various non-destructive testing methods for example, dye penetration and radiography testing. Learnt about the instruments used for indication, control and actuation of the plant processes. It was worth working, experiencing, interacting and learning with Linde.",
