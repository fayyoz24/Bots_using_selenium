    "summary": "Glass is a human-made material for thousands of years, so we should know everything about it by now, right? Well... It is not that simple. \n\nIn an ever-changing world facing crucial environmental challenges, we constantly need to evolve, to innovate and to produce smarter products with a lower footprint. This transformation is not something we can achieve alone, it is a collective challenge all around the world and at every position within the glass industry. On this path towards progress, knowledge is key. I am proud to empower members of the glass community with basic science, awareness and inspiration to improve many technical aspects of their glass melting process.  \n\nOur aim is to train and support you and your team towards a future-proof glass production. At CelSian Academy, we answer many questions such as:\n- How are glass composition and properties linked?\n- How to select the best raw materials and cullet? And how is it affected by REACH regulation?\n- How to efficiently convert batch into melt?\n- How does an industrial glass furnace operates? What are the different types and design?\n- What is redox and why is everybody speaking about it?\n- How to colour glass and why reduced colours are so difficult?\n- How to fine your melt efficiently?\n- Can we do something against foaming?\n- How to diagnose bubble, seeds and solid defects?\n- How to improve heat transfer towards the glass bath?\n- What is at stake with evaporation from the melt?\n- What are the refractory materials used in a glass melting furnace?\n- How to improve combustion and reduce NOx?\n- What are the emission limits and how to achieve them?\n- How to improve the energy efficiency of your process?\n- How can control help you produce better?\n- How to produce glass more sustainably? \n- What about carbon capture, electrical melting and electrical boosting?\n\nWe originally come from TNO glass research institute, and we accumulated decades of experience on glass science and technology. We LOVE to share so feel free to challenge us with your own issues !",

Most importantly, we excel at bringing the dry scientific results back into the real world, in the form of a report and recommendations applicable at the process scale.\n\nThrough all the process, my favourite part is probably the frequent chat with our customers to inform them about results and build together a great, applicable solution.",

Then it became a small project based on trial-and-error reformulation. But improving a good glass formulation at random in a 7-dimension system of oxides with redox-sensitive properties had very little chances to happen. So we took a step back, dived in phase diagrams and found a very promising compositional space. Lab validated. Pilot validated. Oh what a journey.\n \nThis project was wonderful not only because of the beautiful science lying behind it. It was a dream project combining a strong industrial will to make a better product, sufficient resources and trust given to the R&D team to fulfil their potential and reach their goals. A masterpiece of joyful and productive partnership between research, development and industrialization.",

I adore applied science, so I was thrilled with any new study. The diversity of topics opened a world full of wanted or undesired crystallization, coloured glasses, mechanically reinforced glasses, insulating glasses, durable or soluble glasses. Saint-Gobain Recherche is a fantastic place for quick learners and willing engineers. The innovative solutions developed during these studies gave rise to a few patent applications, which made me feel very proud. \n\nIn addition to the technical knowledge about formulation, structure and properties of glass, some studies required the modelling of thermodynamic properties using FactSage. Improving my understanding of thermodynamics is one of the most rewarding and useful learnings of this period.\n\nSome say the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone. That's something I applied many times, by contributing to the famous Universit\u00e9 du Verre, the internal training of Saint-Gobain company. I gave regular interventions in French and English on flat glass, glass formulation and structure-properties relationship. \n\nManagement? Yes. I had the opportunity to manage a few brilliant trainees and technicians at the edge of retirement or at the beginning of their fresh career.",
