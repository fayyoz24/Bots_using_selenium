    "summary": "I have a PhD in cultural anthropology and a career as a researcher and evaluator that has allowed me to support social activists, policy makers, and funders who are imagining, building, and aspiring to create better futures. My research skills are in feminist ethnography, evaluation, and participatory approaches to learning. I lead and support evidence-building initiatives that communicate the impact of feminist movements to wider audiences. My motivation is to find opportunities to work at the intersection of research, practice, and policy change. I thrive in work environments that value critical thinking, exploration, and where decisions are made based on values and evidence.",
