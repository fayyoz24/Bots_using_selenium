    "summary": "\ud83d\ude01 Hi, I am Anouk, 25 years old and my passion lies in hospitality and customer experience.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 My love for technology in the hospitality sector really grew during my bachelor at the Hogere Hotelschool in Maastricht and my Master of Arts at the Hotelschool The Hague in Amsterdam. I am really fascinated by how we can improve the guest experience using technology, data and innovation. During my bachelor I already worked on several projects involving the design of hotel applications. And during my Master's, I was able to indulge completely in digitizing the hotel industry.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Curiosity drove me to learn more about online data. During my Master, terms like IoT, big data and blockchain came up often, but I really wanted to dive deeper into it and understand it in practice. That led me to Merkle, where I took a traineeship in Data, Tech & Optimization. Here I learned all kinds of things about data collection, tech integrations and improving online user experiences.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d I believe my passion for technology, combined with my background in hospitality, gives me unique insights and enables me to come up with valuable solutions to challenges within customer experience and digital developments in the industry. I am really looking forward to further expanding my knowledge and contributing to the evolution of the hospitality industry. If you feel like exchanging ideas or working on cool projects together, please don't hesitate.\n\nCustomer Experience | Consultancy | Digital Developments | Innovation | Change management | Artificial Intelligence",
