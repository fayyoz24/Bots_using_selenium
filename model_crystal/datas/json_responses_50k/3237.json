            "description": "I took part in two Erasmus+ projects, but my experiences were very different, since in one of them I was a local host in my home-town, and in the other an international volunteer in Serbia.\n\nSome of the roles I had in the first project were: organizing activities, planning for when volunteering at a local penitentiary and being a translator for the international participants. Besides these, we had different workshops of non-formal education and grew a lot culturally. During the two weeks my language interpretation skills and cultural sensitivity developed tremendously.\n\nThe project I went on abroad focused on democracy. We grew familiar with European political norms, and also exercised our voting rights as mature citizens. In addition, we had to organize some events involving the locals. As part of the logistics department I had to work closely together with my team and with all the other departments and coordinate the organization of the events, assign tasks, and write the projects, as well as discuss feedback with each head of the ministries. I was also co-managing the social media pages. The two-week project has had a huge evolutionary impact on my team-managing aptitudes, and have helped me grow both as a coordinator and as a team player, increasing my sense of responsibility and awareness to an intercultural environment.\n"
