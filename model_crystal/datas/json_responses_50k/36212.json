    "summary": "Hello, welcome and lovely that you ended up on my page! \nI am an enthusiastic, enterprising and eager to learn financial / business economist, a real go-getter with a sense of responsibility and I have a flexible attitude. My communication and social skills are well developed, I am analytical, work accurately and always solution-oriented. I am known for my helicopter view and am always interested in process improvements within the company. \nAfter experiencing a burnout two years ago, I am back to business and fully up and running. Because of this event I know what I want and prioritizing is what I now do every day. Since July 2020 I have a beautiful son and because of this I work 32 hours a week. After all, he will always be my priority number 1.",
