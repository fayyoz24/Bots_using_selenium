    "summary": "As I am a fresh TU Delft graduate, I am eager to bring my energy and skills to a growing and passion-driven environment. Regardless of the places I have been and the projects I got involved in, I always found my way towards lab or workshop based projects as I truly enjoy holding the results of my work in my hands. Moreover, I worked with people from different backgrounds which helped me understand my work from new perspectives which enabled me to become more aware of the multiple dimensions of each challenge. Having said this, from now on I am looking forward to working in the same fashion.",
