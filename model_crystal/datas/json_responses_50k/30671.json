    "summary": "I am a skilled Java developer with 5 years of experience in a Java-based environment. Having worked on a variety of projects and across different teams, I have greatly developed my technical and problem solving skills as well as acquired knowlegde on agile methodologies and various phases of the software development process. At the same time, I have developed my communication skills from working directly not only with other developers, but also with designers and project managers. Working on fast-paced and demanding projects has taught me how to effectively complete my tasks as well as support the rest of my team when needed. \n\nI am looking for a company who will allow me to continue to develop my knowledge and offer me new challenges.\n\nI am interested in roles in the following areas: the Hague, Rotterdam, Zoetermeer, Delft, Leiden, Gouda, Amsterdam.",

More specifically, its outcome was the design and implementation of a Java algorithm that simulates a world of agents with the ability to solve the resource management problem based on certain data and assumptions.\n\nThe first part of the project included a general research on the problem and a brief introduction to agents and multi-agent systems focusing on their ability to communicate, cooperate, negotiate and make decisions.The second part of the project included the simulation of the problem (definition of agents-servers, resource consumers, environment hosting them) and the design of the algorithm. The aim of the algorithm was the coordination of the agents so that they can use the resources that they have at their disposal in order to serve the consumers' needs in the best possible way, while satisfying some criteria.\n\nThe algorithm was implemented in Java programming language and JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment  Framework) platform - version 4.2.0 helped in the creation of agents and exploitation of their characteristics. JADE offers a variety of features and tools that served the needs of the project, such as support of communication (FIPA ACL) and negotiation (Contract Net) protocols, provision of yellow and white pages services as well as graphical tools mostly used for the observation of message exchange among the agents. The project was developed in NetBeans 7.2 IDE.",
