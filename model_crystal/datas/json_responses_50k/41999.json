The Curatorial Research Collective (CRC) is an interdisciplinary research and design group that critically engages with the theories and practices of architecture culture, questioning their multiple discourses and broader societal frameworks. While our collective research endeavour is varied\u2014ranging from exhibitions and archives to the digital and physical space of institutions, from biennials to themed environments, we operate with the conviction that thinking is collective, and that the culture of what is curatorial is in permanent flux. Embedded within the chair of Architecture History and Theory at the Department of the Built Environment at TU Eindhoven, the CRC is directed by dr. Sergio M. Figueiredo and supported by Prof. Bernard Colenbrander.\nEnacting both practical and theoretical approaches through research, exhibitions, and public programs since 2016, the CRC\u2019s research projects have been presented, among others, at the Dutch Design Week, CASA Vertigo at TU/e, Shunck, the VAI/deSingel, and Het Nieuwe Instituut.\n\nMy PhD research  is supported by a grant from the Van Beek-Donner Foundation.",

Architectural history makes us aware of the long lines of development that designers are part of, which are humbling and inspiring at the same time. \nAs lecturer of Architectural History at the ArtEZ Academy of Architecture, I introduce first year students of Architecture and Urban Planning  in the history of their discipline, always connecting todays practice with history that surrounds us in many \u2013 sometimes surprising \u2013 ways. Students of the second year will embark on a journey of reviewing architectural history along a variety of lines like gender, sustainability, participation and more, sharpening their own views on the way, equipping themselves for a discipline that is intimately connected with existing buildings and environments.",
