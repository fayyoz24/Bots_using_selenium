I have created an novel algorithm that uses a combination of statistics and machine learning that is very good at detecting anomalies in financial systems even when there are low amounts of traffic. There has been a lot of interest in the company and we are looking to put the algorithm into production as a proof of concept.\n\nI have realized business process models of the merchant onboarding at equensWorldline and implement these models using the IBM toolkit called IBMBPM. This makes the merchant onboarding process transparent, more efficient, and less error prone.",
