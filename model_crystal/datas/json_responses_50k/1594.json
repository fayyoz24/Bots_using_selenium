    "summary": "As an ambitious professional, who is all-round, accurate and reliable, I like to do thorough research in close cooperation with colleagues. Educated as an international economist at Tilburg University, I am interested in economic and financial issues. In research projects I like to peel the onion, make connections between multiple aspects, while overseeing the bigger picture.\n\nThe aim of the Dutch Safety Board (Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid) is to draw conclusions from accidents, so the industry can learn from it. Working for the Dutch Safety Board as a financial investigator, it is my job to investigate the financial aspects of an accident, which is often an underlying cause.\n\nAs an auditor at the Netherlands Court of Audit I was involved in the EU Economic Governance project and coordinator of the Financial Stability Instruments part. Before 2011, I was involved in multiple audits related to EU policy and EU funding. \n\nDuring the parliamentary year 2014-2015, I was seconded to the Dutch House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal) as a deputy clerk for the committee on EU affairs and as an EU advisor to the Finance committee and the committee on Government Spending.",
