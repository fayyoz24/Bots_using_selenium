    "summary": "I am a practical oriented market researcher who is able to unravel unknown topics and translate this into action. \n\nWhen I was the Advisor to the CEO at Arion, I was involved in the development of the new strategy of Arion for the time period 2015-2019. During this process, I stressed the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainability. Consequently, I became the CSR Manager of Arion. In the time in which I had this job position, I also started a PhD in March 2015 at the Maastricht University. The topic of my PhD research was the bed bath and the washing without water concept. I finished my research and thereby obtained my PhD at December 7th, 2021 with the defense of my dissertation called \"The bed bath with or without water? It's a wash!\"\n\nFrom July 2021 until now, I work fulltime at Arion again as a Strategic Project Manager - Sustainability. In this position I work on strategic projects that are important for the future of Arion. These projects are conducted in Team Tomorrow of which I am a team member. In addition to these strategic projects, I remain responsible for sustainability at Arion. In this latter role, I coordinate sustainability projects and engage colleagues to contribute to sustainability.\n\nSpecialties: \n- CSR and sustainability\n- Market research \n- Strategy development\n- Subsidies\n- IPR\n- Innovation\n- Marketing\n\nMusic is my biggest passion. I play the keys and sing in the coverband \"the Neighbours\".",
