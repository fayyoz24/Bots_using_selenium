    "summary": "Currently advancing as a Philosophy PhD Candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I specialize in the intersections of Artificial Intelligence and Epistemic Autonomy, merging academia with an extensive professional history.\n\nAs Global Operations Manager for a celebrated orchestra conductor, I'm at the helm of business operations, marketing strategies, and global brand growth. Previously, I worked in Tech for Oracle in Dublin and drove innovative digital marketing at Philharmonie Luxembourg.\n\nIn the early stages of my career, I practiced European Law.\n\nCollectively, my experiences encompass philosophy, technology, law, foreign relations, European economics, and classical music. This blend forms an interdisciplinary perspective that informs my approach to problem-solving and innovation. Let's connect if these fields interest you!",
