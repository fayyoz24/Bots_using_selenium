    "summary": "As a dedicated, results-oriented public health worker with international experience, I work constructively in the positive transformation of communities from the grassroots level to the national policy level. I specialise in sexual and reproductive health programming, organisational leadership and transformation, digital media for social change and programme management for non-governmental organisations, leading multiple teams across the African continent (Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe), working with donor agencies in Germany, and more recently leading global teams from the Netherlands. \n\nMy professional background began in health care management in Zimbabwe. My areas of expertise and focus have been project management for primary health care and sexual and reproductive health and rights, resource mobilisation in crisis contexts, public health surveillance, treatment and prevention mechanisms for communicable diseases; and feminist movement-building for vulnerable groups where grassroots communities are not only recipients of aid and services, but also become agents of change within their localities.  \n\nMore recently I have widened my scope to work through public health communication and digital media, and movement-building in hostile contexts on issues such as gender-based violence, structural violence, extractives and the climate crisis, with special emphasis on community empowerment of young people, LGBTI community members, rural and indigenous groups and environmental and human rights activists. \n\nIn my work, I always place special emphasis on equal opportunities for people on the margins, and I believe that my down to earth, practical approach is a proven asset to the many challenges faced in fragile and resource constrained environments.",

RNW Media is a Netherlands-based NGO for social change that works globally to ensure that young people speak freely about important issues that affect them. The REA programme under Amplify Change focuses on reaching young people via digital media using platforms such as Love Matters to talk to young people about love, sex, and relationships from a pleasure-friendly perspective. This is an online-based project, so young people can access all the information they need from their phones, without having to engage with a third party. The REA programme also strengthens local organisations working with young people in various countries such as Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria and India to improve their online presence and better reach their target communities with messages that are up-to-date, accurate and accessible. As the REA Programme Coordinator my role is to lead these various country teams in their work to engage young people to claim their sexual and reproductive health rights and empower their LGBTI communities.",
