    "summary": "As a young child growing up, I developed a love for all things Engineering. I would often try to open small machines to see why they function the way they did, this fascination propelled me to invest my time in deep study of further mathematics, physics, chemistry, and introductory technology, and subsequently in applying for and obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. I am positive soul and sure facilitator who would always choose progress with its attendant uncertainties than stagnation or status quo. I have always viewed life as a glass half-filled with so many opportunities coming my way to make a positive difference, challenges and difficulties abound, but they only served to bring out optimal results from me.\nI desire to lead a life of research in Mechanics/Material design, Tribology, nanoscience, Experimental Physics, in the process inquiring, coordinating and associating natural laws for the implementing novel solutions that serves humanity. I am not above charity work, I shall give back to humanity in every way possible.",

            "description": "In this Project, an immunoassay based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to investigate SARs-CoV-2 antibody for its characteristic Raman fingerprint. Characterization of SERS substrate like Nano porous gold, gold nanoparticles deposited on topaz and coated on borosilicate glass showed a decent Plasmon enhancement factor of about 103 to 104 , it was also observed on all SERS substrate that a 1\u00b5m root mean square roughness height of deposited nanoparticles was sufficient for SERS enhancement. \nThe immobilization of the Genetex SARs-CoV-2 was done using Cysteamine hydrochloride and Lomants reagent, linkage was only possible only after sufficient cleaning was effected on the SERS substrates, the Raman spectrum obtained was same for both protocols, however noise and substrate instability was observed. The presence of Cysteamine Hydrochloride monolayers was confirmed by the Raman peaks 510, 643, 726, 938, 1015, 2557, 2928, and 2962cm\u22121 each respectively assigned to \u03bd(S \u2212 S), \u03bd(C \u2212 S), \u03bd(C \u2212 S), \u03bd(C \u2212 C(\u2212N)), \u03bd(C \u2212 C(\u2212N)), \u03bd(S \u2212 H), \u03bdas(CH2) and \u03bds(CH2). \nThe characteristic disulfide band, Aliphatic and Aromatic bands, Amide I and Amide III bands were identified for both linking protocols and tentatively assigned.  Worthy of note is the detection of different conformation of thiol on the surface of the glass slide, since adsorption of the thiol monolayers was from solution a Langmuir growth model is proposed as the means of thiol growth and orientation.",
