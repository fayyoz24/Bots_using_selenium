    "summary": "I have been working as a manager in IC design for many years. I like to get the most out of people in terms of creativity, productivity and quality of work. I like to work with and for people who enjoy their work and are open for continuous improvements. So I try to be easy accessible, to listen without an immediate answer but also challenge others to be open and honest. No hidden agendas. Growth and improvement of working methods is not only based on sharing your successes. It is also based on (or maybe even more important) showing minor aspects and considering/communicating improvement measures.\n\nCreativity is a major driver for me. Try to find a solution beyond the obvious. Question why things are as they seem to be (not always of course). Based on my (technical) education and experience I understand what can be done with various materials, but also with electronic components, analogue as well as digital and to some extend even microprocessors. As such I supported design reviews  and the IC architecture for intelligent power switches and charger related IC\u2019s for industry leading customers. Also I designed and build systems for microprocessor based home automation and lightning solutions.",
