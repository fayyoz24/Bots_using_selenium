    "summary": "\u203b I love to work in the Social Domain and focus on preventive solutions, or working with organisations whose focus is on inclusiveness & social entrepreneurship and/or purposeful investments. I'm open for setting up a meeting and discuss if there are ways to collaborate.\n\n\u203b Energetic results-orientated and creative Social Economic Business Impact Developer. Pragmatic strategic thinker who has an eye for relational aspects and takes a coaching and empowering approach when leading others. Is motivated by getting things done through shared value partnership. My career includes experience with NGO's, municipalities, social enterprises and corporate companies in Europe, the Far East and Africa as well as setting up my \u201csocial\u201d enterprises, which results in a well defined skill set. \n\n\u203bDuring my time abroad and travels I have gained a lot of knowledge about different cultures and therefore I am good in building relationship of trust with the different stakeholders and find it \ninteresting to be involved in culture sensitive assignments.\n\n\u203b I am good at goal-oriented networking, a facilitator, entrepreneurial and an organiser. I am observant, have an eye for details, \"like connecting the dots\" and are creative in finding purpose driven solutions.\n\n\u203bAfter 22 years living and working on the Africa Continent (Uganda, Kenya and South Africa) I have moved back to the Netherlands. My extensive experience has afforded me first- hand knowledge of the social economic operating environment and its challenges and opportunities on the African Continent.\n\n\u203bProvided strategic business and project impact advice focusing on SDG\u2019s 1,4,5,7,8,10,12 and 13, did company assessments, developed concepts and coached entrepreneurs and students. Also established my own Chocolate Company which was a Social Enterprise. Soulicious Chocolate became a finalist of the \u201cSymrise new food product competition\u201d in 2008 and was distributed to 55 shops in Southern Africa.\n\n\u203b I am eager to learn, like to go to pitching sessions of social entrepreneurs because I find it very interesting to know what other change agents are doing to make the world more inclusive.\n\n \u2706 +31 6 1033 1688\n\u2709 datje.van.reijendam @ gmail.com",
