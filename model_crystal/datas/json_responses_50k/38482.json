The students are divided in different groups (Consultancy Teams), each of which will work individually to come up with a viable development proposal.\nWithin these groups of students they will also have their own individual roles. The cooperation between the students which come from a diverse number of studies will be the central aspect. The case of the Consultancy Week often involves a large scale city centre restructuring. This time the case study was: Amsterdam Sloterdijk Teleport. Our team ended up second best.\n",

It is an exploring research on the characteristics of parking real estate in order to review the attractiveness of car parks for real estate investors.\n\nThe real estate market has changed rapidly and the risks of real estate investments are being reconsidered. This has implications for the consideration in which asset there will be invested. At this moment there is an increasing social and commercial interest in parking real estate. This interest is strengthened by the poor investment performances of other real estate sectors over the past few years. However, in comparison to other real estate sectors, parking real estate functions differently and can be seen as a real estate category that doesn\u2019t function on its own. In the future a car park is going to be more and more important for the functioning of city centers all over the world, which makes it a social relevant subject. \n\nSince the parking investment market is really intransparant, it is hard for investors to distinguish which car park investment is interesting. This study contributes to this challenge by defining the attractiveness of car parks as investment product. The attractiveness is in this research distinguished by the return- risk profile of the investments. When looking at the return- risk profile of Bouwfonds IM\u2019s car parks, it seems that the most important characteristic types concerning the attractiveness are: environmental-, accessibility-, competition-, property and functionality characteristics.",

The board consists of 7 very hard working and enthusiastic members. We were lucky to be the board of study association SERVICE during the 4th lustrum. We tried to make it a truly memorable lustrum year for the members, alumni and university. We did this by organizing many activities, like: 3 symposia with corresponding magazines, a business trip to London, a study trip to Moscow and St. Petersburg and a lustrum week consisting of  an excursion, full day symposium, workshops and finally a big closing party. Reflecting on last year we organized a lot of fun and educational activities and we can look back satisfied.",
