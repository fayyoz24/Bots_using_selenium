    "summary": "During the innovation traineeship I recently took part in, I was able to find my ambition for the next job through my different experiences in roles, companies and industries. I wish to pursue a career within data analysis and innovation management.  I found the interest to pursue a career within data science, a passion I found after creating power BIs, implementing python models, and being the translator between the data and the business department.  Once I found my career ambitions, I pursued an external course to dig deeper into this interest and received an IBM Data Science Certificate from Coursera. In my dream job, I would be able to combine data science in an innovative environment, where data insights can contribute to creating a more robust technology and/or solution.",
