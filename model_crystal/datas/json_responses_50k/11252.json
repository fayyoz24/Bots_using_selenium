    "summary": "I am a Legal Counsel specializing in Maritime and International Commercial Law. \nMy practice involves dispute resolution arising from: charterparties and contracts of affreightment, bills of lading, bunker supply contracts, third party employment contracts (for example, stevedoring and terminal operations); international sale of goods; marine insurance and general average matters; salvage; ships\u2019 and offshore operations in general. \nMy international commercial practice embraces non-contentious tasks such as delivering specific advice appropriate to the business needs and drafting standard terms of contracts.  \n\nI similarly handle all types of P&I and FDD claims. I am specifically involved in matters arising from: physical damage to and loss of cargo; damage to the ship\u2019s hull and machinery, damage to the shore-based structures; breach of contract, esp in the context of time charters and voyage charters; demurrage disputes.\nI negotiate settlements of claims inter alia with cargo interests and disponent shipowners, seeking recourse against third parties if and when possible and necessary. \nSimilarly, have an extensive experience in handling the court and arbitration proceedings arising out in the UK and in other foreign jurisdictions. I undertake a task of appointing and managing correspondents, surveyors and lawyers anywhere in the world. \nMy most recent work has involved casualty cases, such as shifting of cargo making the ship unseaworthy, collision, damage to hull, and wreck removal off Belgium waters.\n\nTaking into account my past PhD research at Swansea University, I have particular expertise in the area of the unification of certain rules of law for international carriage of goods by sea, and particular knowledge in the international regulations relating to transport documents (esp. bills of lading).\nMy studies covered various fields of law. \nI take full advantage of a joined community of established researchers and contribute to a diverse intellectual environment.\n\nI have a strong technical background: my 24 years\u2019 experience in the shipping industry includes 13 years at sea serving on different types of vessels in different ranks.\nI am a Qualified Master Mariner",
