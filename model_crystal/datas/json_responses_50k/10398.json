    "summary": "I didn't intend to become an educator.\nI was going to be a scientist.\nbut I am so glad I made the change.\nNow older and wiser, I am still an educator, but can no longer agree with the secondary education system and I am seeking work elsewhere. \n\nThroughout my younger life, I loved sharks, spaceships and black-holes, but it turns out I enjoy teaching others about the wonders of the universe rather than discovering a tiny sliver of deep knowledge myself. \n\nI believe in educating and inspiring students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and I am passionate about improving societal knowledge of how the world works and improving education as a whole. \n\nBy the age of 21, I was studying astrophysics, chemistry and mathematics and had founded and was running my own small business Atomic tutoring. \n\nBy 23, Atomic Tutoring had run its course with over 15 tutors and more than 60 students involved in the business during the time of operation. I had also gained an honours degree in astrophysics and been teaching around 80 students per class at university impacting literally hundreds of university students per year as well. \n\n'Atomic' closed because I was given a wonderful opportunity to move overseas and start my current job at the International Baccalaureate (IB) working on the Middle Years Programme (MYP). This is the moment, when I truly began to help change education for more students than I had ever thought possible. Literally thousands and thousands of student take and are impacted by the MYP and about 1,000,000 students or so will take one of IB's four programmes every year. \n\nSince I help develop the curriculum and work with the brilliant educators who make these programmes everyday, I can literally help improve the schooling of about 1 million students \n(not many can claim that for their day job). \n\nNow over 25, I work as a full-time science teacher at a Dutch international school, but i am looking for my next position in either science or education or perhaps even better - science education! \n\nCertified Microsoft innovative educator with broad community experience (over 70 badges and 50 certificates).
