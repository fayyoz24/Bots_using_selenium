    "summary": "A 12+ year experienced structural engineer, who is currently working as a structural specialist for lightweight aluminum helidecks and structures. Also, I have performed during his career history as a structural designer, analyzer and consultant for several commercial, industrial and residential projects. I have not only a strong background on the structural mechanics but also practical experience to apply the construction principles for complex structures. Moreover, I possess comprehensive experience in FEM/FEA modelling for advanced analysis of strength and stiffness at the different scales of construction. I also have experienced computer programming skills for structural calculation tool development. I has advanced knowledge on several structural standards and regulations for buildings as well as offshore structures. He always expects challenges to nonstop improve himself in skills and experience",
