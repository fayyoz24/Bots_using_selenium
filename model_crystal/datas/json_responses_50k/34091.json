    "summary": "Internationalization, education, and policy-making are topics that fascinate me. I have a true passion for the field of education and see education as a great tool of soft diplomacy; to change the world and collaborate between nations on a different level. After obtaining my graduate degrees abroad, I worked several years in the field of secondary and higher education in Colombia, Mexico, and the Netherlands.  In the classroom I always focused on teaching my students to become global citizens with 21st century skills and preparing them for education abroad, making sure they have the right soft skills to be successful. \n\nAs an international professional, I can easily work inter-culturally. I have a true passion for international education. I have also been actively involved in the organization of international university fairs in Central and North America, as in the Caribbean. I am an active member of network that connects international college counsellors at high schools in Latin America, in which we bring higher education opportunities closer to our students in the region, share knowledge and best practices, and ensure that all schools have access to the same resources and university contacts. This has led to increased opportunities worldwide, for all more students in this region. \n\nCurrently, I work as Fieldwork Coordinator at the BSc Global Studies program at Maastricht University. Here I continue to connect higher education globally, looking for ways to connect engaged global citizens and collaborate internationally via education.",
