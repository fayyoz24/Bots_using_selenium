The plan is to expand the entries to include more directors in the upcoming years. This database will be linked to a WordPress website that will provide a cleaner front framework to organize the contents of the database into an encyclopedia. The website will provide English-speaking theater-makers with a lot of information relating to Russian theater. The website will bring Russian theater and those directors closer to US theater-makers and make their works accessible to a new, larger audience.",
