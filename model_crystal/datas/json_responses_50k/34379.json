    "summary": "What interests me the most about the marine environment is the ecosystem services they provide. I find it important to safeguard these services but also allow for society to make use of these resources available to us. The past ten years I have worked on multiple projects aimed at investigating the human impact on resources in for example my role at SMA Zeeland B.V. as a soil contamination consultant or as the project co\u00f6rdinator in the FINPlast project (microplastic ingestion by Atlantic cod and saithe in Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands) which was a cooperation between researchers from the UW in Iceland, NIVA in Norway and Havstovan in the Faroe Islands. Earlier I  worked as a research assistant and technician as part of the team developing protocols for producing high quality fertilized eggs for lumpfishat Nofima in Norway. In research I look for the practical implication in society and I am intrigued by projects regarding coastal and marine resource management.",
