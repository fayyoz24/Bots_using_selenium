    "summary": "For as long as I could remember, a vibrant living environment has always been a personal goal of mine. One of the reasons that inspired and still inspires me to do what I do is that we are all looking for a good life. \nArising from this inspiration, I am currently studying for a master\u2019s degree in Environmental and Infrastructure Planning at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I hope to put this useful knowledge to good use in planning for urban landscapes, rural developments, regional growth, and other spatial scopes at different scales.\nBuilding on three years of experience working for the Local Government Service Commission of Zambia in the Chama district, I seek to continue to add value to any and every environment given the privilege to do so. Besides the usual design of local area plans, forward planning, and development control, I would like to incorporate water management, and transition management among others.\nNo matter what ethnic backgrounds we come from, we all share a collective and universal appreciation. And this is reflected in the way we shape our environments. We all desire a good life.",
