    "summary": "After completing my Masters in Mechanical Engineering, I began my career as the Energy Efficiency Engineer and Manager for Kroger's Pacific Northwest division, where I also helped found their existing solar program. After several years, I began working as a Senior Systems Design Engineer for SoCore Energy and eventually transitioned to project management and held the position of Vice President of Portfolio Management where I was in charge of MW solar installations for commercial properties. \n\nIn 2014, I moved to Utrecht to pursue my Masters in Sustainable Development. At the same time I worked with African Clean Energy by assisting in project management and grant writing. I compelted my PhD in Environmental Technology in 2022 where I focused on desalination technologies and their impacts. I am now a course coordinator and urban data project lead for the MADE Programme (Amsterdam) and GRS (Wageningen). \n\nIn addition to my education and career path, I have a personal passion for sustainable design/living, cycling, and mass transit.",
