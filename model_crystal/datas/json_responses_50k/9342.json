    "summary": "I possess an interdisciplinary education and research background, with solid experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Data-driven research especially in Transportation and Shared Mobility. Now, as a Ph.D. researcher, I am working on Automated Vehicles' Safety in Mix Traffic, trying to expand the Operation Design Domain of AV with data-driven deep learning methods from both aspects of perception and controlling.\n\nI am keen on and enjoy analyzing cross-domain data, uncovering the hidden beauty of Real-World-Big-Data. I minored in Big Data Master Project during my master's years at Tsinghua University (Top 1 in China), and the IBM Deep Learning Professional Certificate program. With the board learning experience, I now can handle large scale multi-sourced heterogeneous data through distributed big data platforms and database tools.\n\nI am a person with immense curiosity, always want to challenge myself with new areas and enjoy the pleasure of conquering one new domain after another. As a result, I gained an interdisciplinary research background (EE->Telecommunication->Automation->Transportation & Data Science & Artificial Intelligence).\n\n\nIn daily life, I would like to explore the world by both traveling, which is an external approach, and meditation which is an internal approach and helps me to feel and understand our world in a unique way. I also strive to pursue the inner peace whose power has been shown in Kungfu Panda, and also the force as demonstrated in the Star Wars series. The experiences of Meditation as well as Pursuing Inner Peace and The Force really help to stimulate my research inspiration, which, I believe, will continue to serve and distinguish me during my research career. \n\nI always feel a sense of mission and responsibility to make our world better. I see machine learning and data-driven interdisciplinary research as my tools for making a little difference in my life, to the world.\n\n\nQuotes:\n\"If anything is worth doing, do it with all your heart.\"\n\"Live in the Present Moment. Irrespective of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are---always.\"\n\"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted really counts.\" ---Alert Einstein\n\nData Alchemist, Buddhist-Taoist yogi, Michael Miracle~~~\nyongqidong.github.io/",
