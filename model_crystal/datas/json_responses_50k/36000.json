    "summary": "I am a Groundwater Specialist at the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC) in Delft, the Netherlands. As a UNESCO center, my position at IGRAC has allowed me to actively contribute to various international projects and initiatives with diverse partners, including the World Water Quality Alliance (WWQA), the World Water Development Report (WWDR) 2022, the H2020-funded Global Gravity-based Groundwater Product (G3P) project, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and many others. These projects align perfectly with my main interest, which is to assess the global status and trends of groundwater in terms of quantity and quality and promote the protection of this vital resource.\n\nBefore joining IGRAC, I gained experience as a project engineer, university lecturer, teaching assistant, and volunteer, particularly during earthquake relief efforts.\n\nMy academic background includes a civil engineering degree from the University of Santiago, Chile, and a joint M.Sc. degree in water science and engineering, with a focus on groundwater and global change, from the GroundwatCH Erasmus Mundus program, involving IST Lisbon, UNESCO-IHE (now IHE Delft), and TU Dresden.",
