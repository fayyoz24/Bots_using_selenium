    "summary": "\nThroughout my academic career, I have been driven by the curiosity to find answers to the  most pressing and pertinent questions. Whether it is writing scripts for games AI or optimizing genome wide association pipelines, I have been able  to  quickly adapt and learn to find solution to different challenges.\nGraduate from the  Hassan II Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Sciences (IAV) as plant pathology engineer, my curiosity and wonder about different genetic components  that govern  the  interaction of  plants and  their pathogens never stopped. Thus,  I tried to expend my knowledge about plant genetics by  carrying out Master of Science in plant breeding (the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Zaragoza). This  new experience  opened new horizons, from plant biotechnology to advanced statistics. The ambition to have a solid  understanding of the art of plant breeding, and to master the philosophy of genetic selection was the major drive for me to advance my academic career in  statistical genetics by carrying  out  a PhD at  Mathematical and Statistical Methods group of Biometris (Wageningen University & Research).\nA brief list of  my skills and competences : \nCompetencies: \n\n\u25a0 data science\n        \u25cb R and python programing language.\n        \u25cb Linux Bash Shell Scripting (Awk & Sed)\n        \u25cb Liner mixed models\n        \u25cb Machine learning (Deep learning)\n        \u25cb Data visualization\n\u25a0 Molecular biology\n        \u25cb PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and   RT-PCR \n        \u25cb Primer Design for PCR.\n        \u25cb Gel Electrophoresis\n        \u25cb Molecular (Gene) Cloning\n",

In recent years studies of responses to combinatorial stresses have been initiated. Two pillars of Integrated Pest Management are host plant resistance and biological control and both of these are influenced to a large extent by plant characteristics. \nIn this project we will investigate the genetic architecture underlying responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to insect herbivores in the context of other biotic and abiotic stresses. This will be done by using a genetically well-characterized plant mapping resources.  \nThe project will focus on plant metabolites (non-volatiles and volatiles)  and will exploit an extensive database that includes phenotypic, genotypic, and metabolomics data. A wide range of statistical and bioinformatics tools will be used to unravel common and unique genetic factors underlying stress responses. \nThe project will be conducted at the Laboratories of Entomology and Genetics and the Biometris group of Wageningen University and will include phenotyping of plant responses, (genetic) analysis of plant metabolites, and modelling of genotype to phenotype relations using bioinformatics and statistical approaches.",

To address this problem, two main objectives were contemplated:\n\n1) Verify under controled experimental conditions the susceptibility and/or resistance responses of different host accessions of melon against several virus infections, and\n\n2) Explore the effects of multiple viral infections on host resistance traits against individual viruses.\n\nBoth objectives were explored in pathosystems of cucurbitaceous host plants (melon), potential vectors (aphids and whiteflies), and combinations of RNA viruses: crinivirus (whitefly transmitted) with potyvirus (aphid transmitted) and/or cucumovirus (aphid transmitted). The choice of the experimental system of host and pathogens derives from the current situation in the mediterranean crop production conditions, where the three groups of viruses are often reported to affect cucurbits crops.",
