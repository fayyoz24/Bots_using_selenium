    "summary": "Hi.  \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc   Nice to meet you. \nI go by Seth; I was born, raised, and educated in South Africa, and in 2021, packed up my life and got on a plane with my wife to pursue a PhD at the prestigious Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, NL.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by science: the prospect of going beneath the surface of understanding appealed greatly to my curious nature. With independent drive, and a creative, innovative approach to problems, as well as the experience I gain during my PhD \u2013 literally a degree in continuous learning \u2013 I am in search of a career that utilizes my hard scientific skills, but also challenges me in the above aspects. \n\nI have a flexible and adaptable personality, and I strive to improve any environment in which I find myself. I value consistency and professionalism and enjoy connecting with and learning from diverse people. I bring positivity, energy, and passion to teams.",

A group of children would stay at camp for one week at a time, and the entire camp lasted a total of 10 weeks. Additionally, the position required lifeguard duties during swimming time in the open water, for roughly 100 children.\n\nBeing a counselor was one of my most challenging but enjoyable undertakings. Working with children in this (often stressful) environment taught me patience and responsibility. I also had to work with staff within a large age range, and from many nationalities. I learnt the importance of appreciation for cultural differences and how to use differences as assets towards achieving a common goal. During this time spent in the USA, I also had the opportunity of qualifying for the first time as a lifeguard, which included CPR, First Aid and Emergency Oxygen. This minimal exposure to the field of medicine ignited great excitement in me to one day become involved in the field myself \u2013 especially in research, another great passion of mine.",
