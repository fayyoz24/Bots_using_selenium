During the week I not only met very friendly and passionate people, though we also visited the facility of Ankole Coffee Producers Cooperative Union LTD (http://www.acpcultd.com/) impressive to see what they have accomplished (also with the support of Agriterra). The last day of the week a former Coffee trader (Charles Angebault, living in Uganda) presented the process (from start to finish/ contract, price etc) to enable export of the high quality Uganda Coffee beans. After an intensive week in Uganda my assignment is done, it is now up to the participants to put it into practise and to start the real work.",
