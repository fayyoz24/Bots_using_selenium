To work in that direction, I have sought out various experiences to broaden my horizons, be dedicated in the work I put myself in, yet be humble and willing to learn. This has developed my urge to re-examine the status quo and constantly building on understanding through empathy.\nMy degrees in Urban Planning and Human Settlements are just two of many platforms available to leverage my acquired experiences, skills, and nature to produce better and happier people. Currently, I have expanded that platform into passionately providing opportunities to maximize potential of individuals. ",
