Working in a comprehensive way on gender, SRHR and education offers important advantages and is more effective in attaining gender justice, good quality education and improved reproductive health.\n\nThis event was meant to be a first step towards better linking and learning as well as more cooperation between practitioners, academics and government officials on education, gender and SRHR. At the same time, the event offered a space to reflect on the opportunities of the new policy of Lilianne Ploumen, the Dutch Minister for International Cooperation and Trade. This policy prioritises women\u2019s rights and SRHR as a spearhead, but at the same time phases out education completely.",
