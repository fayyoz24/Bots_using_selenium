    "summary": "MSc student majoring in animal sciences, nutrition, and metabolism. The specialization is the dairy sector. My vision is to become an advisor in the international animal husbandry sector (ruminants). My mission is to support farmers and to contribute toward a more sustainable World.\nThe short-term goal is to finalize my MSc degree (2022-2024) and get a relevant PhD project. The long-term goals are to realize myself as a specialist, to further develop my Dutch language, and to finalize my naturalization in the Netherlands (2 out of 7 integration tests are left).\nAs the end goal, after gaining more experience, knowledge, and resources, I am planning to establish my own advisory business, as well as to pass the knowledge/skills to the next generation of specialists. I do believe that such an approach will allow to preserve knowledge and multiply it, and thus the mission will be continued more efficiently and on a greater scale in the future.",

Alternative strategy efficiency was analyzed via estimations of new forage quantity and quality, new ration balance, and potential performance of the milking herd upon that ration. Finally, all potential costs of alternative land use/changes were calculated. \nFinal score: 9.0",
