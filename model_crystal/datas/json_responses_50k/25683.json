    "summary": "I am an experimental physicist with a PhD in Nanophotonics and a strong background in Electronics & Communication. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I specialize in photonic nanostructures and devices fabrication, as well as optical setup design and building. With extensive experience in optical microscopy, laser physics, statistical methods, software development, and electronics, I possess a passion for problem-solving and adapt quickly to new learning.\nIn my career, I have demonstrated a keen ability to work collaboratively in multidisciplinary teams, while also excelling in project management. With an expertise in analytical techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Photoluminescence, Spectrophotometry, and cleanroom equipment such as Wet Bench, Photolithography, Dip Pen Nanolithography, and Direct Laser Writing, I am skilled in the simulation, fabrication, and characterization of photonic structures, integrated optics, nanophotonic devices, and metamaterials.\nI am proficient in programming environments such as Matlab, LabView, and simulation packages like Lumerical, Origin, and WaveSim. My soft skills, including project management, team collaboration, communication, leadership, and accountability, have enabled me to excel in organizational roles and supervise both Master and Bachelor students for their research projects. Furthermore, I have experience in teaching as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate and postgraduate students in \"Physics Experimental Lab\" and \"Electronics Lab.\"\nThroughout my career, I have been recognized for my achievements with various awards and fellowships, such as the Travel Grant for Complex Nanophotonics Science, the Incubic Milton Chang Travel Grant CLEO, the SPIE Student Travel Grant, the DST Govt. of India International Travel Grant, the Best Poster Award at the 3rd Physics Day 2018 IIT Ropar, and the Appreciation Certificate at Research Conclave 2018 IIT Ropar, and the Best Poster Award at the 2nd Physics Day 2017 IIT Ropar.\nAs a self-starter with a goal-oriented and result-driven mindset, I am flexible and adaptable to changing workloads and deadlines. With the ability to think on a functional level and translate system concepts into design specifications.",
