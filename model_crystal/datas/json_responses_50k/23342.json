Indeed, there has been some research papers performing content analysis on books that their researchers found successful to identify common characteristics in factors such as themes, writing styles, and characters. But there has been no research viewing such factors from the perspectives of the audience. A research project includes surveying the readers\u2019 opinions regarding the importance of each factor in successful young adult dystopian books (the reader-response methodology) can fill in this knowledge gap. With that research, data has been collected and by analyzing it, it is concluded that young adult dystopian literature is more appealing to teenagers that share the same psychologically developmental experiences with the protagonist within such literature.\"",

It also tries to break the Vietnamese prejudice that people of the LGBT community people cannot succeed by showing examples of successful queer people. The second session discusses how toxic masculinity in the Vietnamese context leads to homophobia.
