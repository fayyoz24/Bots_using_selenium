This question is of particular relevance, as public services markets and consumers in these markets face ever increasing pressures especially after the crisis in 2008-2010, to which the Member States and the EU reacted in very  different ways. The research will produce, in particular, an in-depth case study in Hungarian public services markets, where in recent years fundamental changes affecting the position of consumers took place.",
