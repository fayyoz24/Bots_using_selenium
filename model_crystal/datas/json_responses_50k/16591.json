    "summary": "Hi there lovely reader. \nIt's so nice to meet you, even though its through the internet.\nI am Marieke. And I love to create. Draw. Illustrate. Write.\n\nI always did, although there have been times in my life that I had forgotten all about it. \n\nBut I am not willing to do that anymore. \n\n'Cause on my quest to awesome self care, following my dreams, and looking my demons in the eye - I accidentally became what I always wanted to be. I drew and wrote a book. And another one. And then some more illustrations went online. And now I work hard to work easy. It's my mission to be the best possible leader I can be to myself: with less work and more play (although this is a challenge, as my strictest boss ever appears to live inside my own head ;)\n\nThrough my books, cards, courses and whatever may be - I share my learnings along this journey to my self with others. With you. Cause the world will truly be a better place, if we'll learn to love living on it.\n\nSo here I am, so grateful to fill my daily life with the creation of books, courses, and uplifting illustrations. And I'll hope you will join me in this revolution of doing less, and seeing more. And above all, I hope you have a great day!\n\nLove, Marieke\n\nPS Curious? Check out www.depridoeboek.nl , or www.mariekelovestodraw.com (more coming on there soon :)\n\nPS 2 I did have a previous life of being a manager of strategies, brands and sustainable missions. And even one of being an awesome adventurer who was never scared to quit her job and move to the other side of the world. All these stories are within me. And have led me to be the magical artist illustrator and writer I now am. \ud83d\udc96",
