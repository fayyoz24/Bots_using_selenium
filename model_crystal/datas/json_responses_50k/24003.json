    "summary": "Having worked as a certified public accountant, accounting manager, controller, CFO, and VP F&A, I have built rich, in-depth knowledge and experience that spans the full finance and accounting functions in several companies across a variety of industries. My creativity, analytical skills, and integrity are important drivers in what I do. Creating and delivering results that go beyond expectations is my hallmark. Excellent communication skills and a talent for \u201cmaking the complex simple\u201d is how I approach the financial function within an organization to help it run efficiently and effectively. On a personal note, I am a practicing musician and composer and that contributes to keeping an excellent balance between business life and personal life. High-level consultancy (partner level or C-suite level) for (clients of) auditing firms, high-growth start-ups in any of the industries mentioned below is what I am interested in. I like to be challenged to step up in situations/projects/assignments that are qualified as \u201cdifficult\u201d by others and where I can use my professional experience to the fullest extent.\n\nContact: wm.phillippe@gmail.com\n\n\n\nKeywords:\n-Venture Capital Funds\n-Start up companies\n-early stage companies\n-SOX compliance (Sarbanes Oxley)\n-Auditing\n-Assurance\n-Financial reporting\n-performance improvement",
