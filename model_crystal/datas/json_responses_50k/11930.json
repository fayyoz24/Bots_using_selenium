    "summary": "With over 15 years of experience in business and sales operations, I am a passionate leader who has helped organizations identify and hire talent while building motivated and high-performing teams. \n\nI have worked with global companies in the hospitality and e-commerce sectors, such as Booking.com, where I managed operations across Latin America and drove new partnerships and revenue growth. Since 2021, I have been running my own HR consultancy and mentorship business, NEW TALENT CENTER, where I guide mid-career professionals to reshape their career path or land their dream job. I also help grads land their internship or kickstart their professional career by building their personal brands and enhancing their skills.\n\nIn addition, I am the Chief Catt Officer at Citycatt, a travel platform that connects travelers with local or traveler ambassadors who plan the most amazing trips for them. I lead the operations and processes to ensure a smooth onboarding, continuous training, and support for our CATTS, who are our most precious assets. My mission is to empower people to discover their potential, achieve their goals, and enjoy their journeys.",
