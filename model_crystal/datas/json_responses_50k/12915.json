NCG specializes in neuromodulation techniques; non-invasive stimulation of the brain via magnetic induction or the appliance of direct current (rTMS & tDCS) mainly in depression and OCD, and also in the use of neurofeedback towards ADHD and sleep disorders. The main aim is to either directely ameliorate aforementioned conditions or strengthen the effects of psychotherapy treatment which is often given simultaneously. We are positioned and recognized as an institute for mental health care. Aside from the neuromodulation treatments, there is a strong focus on neuroscientific research with the goal to improve the treatment techniques (precision medicine & response prediction via biomarkers) and explore new application possibilities. We strive to include every patient in ongoing research and there is a neurophysiology lab integrated within the practice that supplies a whole range of diagnostic procedures & instruments like qEEG and neuropsychological evaluation. The neuroCare Group is active in the Netherlands with treatment centers in Nijmegen, Arnhem, Den Haag, Hengelo, Groningen, Eindhoven and Amsterdam, and we have clinics  in Munich in Germany, Nashville & Long Island in the US, Bologna in Italy, and Sydney & Melbourne in Australia. While neuroCare is the treatment division, we also supply practice-oriented medical devices via neuroCare Solutions and provide (online) training courses and workshops via neuroCademy. Since 2018 I fulfill the position of senior lecturer for (online) neuroCademy for the rTMS and neurofeedback courses.  Aside from treating patients and teaching, I also manage the GZ-opleiding (health psychology) for neuroCare to help other therapists gain their title as health care psychologist.",

It offers several post-graduate training programs, one of which is the 2-year \"GZ-opleiding\" or Health Psychology (explained elsewhere). \nI teach within a 15 week course titled \"Clinical Neuropsychology\" which is one of the major courses in the second year. I work within a team of several other teachers with a clinical background. The aim of the course is for students to develop a basic understanding of neuropsychology as it is applied in a diverse array of clinical and outpatient settings. Students have to acquire knowledge about neuroanatomy, functional neuroanatomy, neuropsychological function domains, imaging techniques, and neuropsychological assessment and treatment. Additionally they learn about several neurological, neuropsychiatric and degenerative diseases that are accompanied by neuropsychological impairment. Besides developing and teaching the course over the last several years, between 2009 and 2018 I also coordinated the team of teachers and facilitated in several other areas like selecting and acquiring literature, compiling and administering the literature examination at the halfway point, and helping students with their neuropsychological case study and grading it (which is the final exam for the course). In 2011 I took part in the mandatory 5-year review of the total course program which was aimed toward gaining renewal of the license to offer the program. In 2012 I was chosen as \"teacher of the year\" by students and colleagues from SPON/RCSW, an honour I'm still very happy with! I also participated in the development and implementation of the \u201cCGO\u201d method that is now used nationally to form the educational backbone of the whole teaching program.",

The mission of the society is to specifically promote the interests of psychologists who are registered as general health psychologist (GZ-psycholoog) or as a specialist in that field (KNP-KP). The \"Ledenraad\" or Council of Members monitors the policies of the Executive Board of the society. It also actively provides policy advice to the Board, i.e. takes the role of \"sounding board\". The Council of Members consists of 24 members who are in their selection a reflection of the professional fields in which health psychologists are active. The Council convenes 2 times a year and can be consulted or convened in between when necessary. Within the Council I hold a special interest in all things related to (the governance of) the education of psychologists, their professional position within health care , and the structure of our \"beroepsgebouw\" or internal professional stratification of aptitude levels. The NVGzP is a very proactive society, driven by concrete results and reacting fast to developments that touch upon the mission of the society.\nSince October of 2022, NVGzP merged with NIP (Dutch Institute for Psychology) to have one national body that represents the interests and societal position of psychology and psychologists. I participated with fellow Council members in the merger to actively monitor and oversee this process, and to safeguard specifically the interests of psychologists that work in healthcare. We as a group judged the merger to be in the greater interest of psychologists than staying apart, while stressing that precautions should be taken to not lose the pro-active culture of the NVGzP and strategic advantages we had while being seperate entities. I will fulfill the rest of my second term within the newly formed Council, consisting of the members of both the old NIP and NVGzP councils.",
