    "summary": "I was assistant professor in Epidemiology. I studied Econometrics and Business Informatics at the Faculty of Economics at the University of Groningen and got my master degree on Business Informatics in 1975. I worked from 1975 until 1984 in the Institute of Economic Research (I.E.O.) at the department of Applied Economic Research, Faculty of Economics, University Groningen. This work consisted of methodological and statistical support to various research groups, that amongst others studied Asthma and COPD.\nSince 1984 I did work in the unit Epidemiology (since 2005 the Department of Epidemiology, unit Epidemiology of pulmonary disease) at the Medical Faculty of Groningen and was head of this unit from 2001-2003.\nMy main research interests are in Asthma and COPD which research is embedded in the Groningen Research Institute of Asthma and COPD (GRIAC). I  supervised the last 4 field surveys of the epidemiological (population-based) cohort study of Vlagtwedde/Vlaardingen on asthma and COPD and the last survey of the EC Respiratory Health Survey. I was/is involved in a large number of patient studies, intervention studies, randomized clinical trials and clinical epidemiological studies in the field of pulmonology and a few animal studies and collaborated in or supervised various PhD projects. I authored/co-authored more than 170 scientific publications and book chapters. I was a Statistical Editor of the European Respiratory Journal. My special research interest is in developing, applying and interpreting of reference equations for spirometric indices ( www.spirxpert.com ).\nMy work consists further on teaching and consultancy on methodology and statistics. My methodological and statistical research interests are mixed effects and event history models on longitudinal data.\nAfter my retirement at the age of 65 I have an honorary appointment at the UMCG, department of Epidemiology and am a member  for methodology of the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the UMCG.",
