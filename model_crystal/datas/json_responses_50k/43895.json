    "summary": "I am an Italian architect. With a background in Architecture and a Master degree in urban regeneration, I have started my professional life as an architect engaged in social planning and urban regeneration programs at the neighbourhood and city level  as coordinator of community-based development projects.\nAlong the years, I have developed an international experience in relation to the urban and metropolitan questions; first in the Netherlands at INTA \u2013 the International Urban Development Association currently based in Paris, then at IFHP \u00ad- the International Federation for Housing and Planning, in Copenhagen. I have organized international exchanges and debates all over Europe, Asia and Latin America, aimed at seeking new understandings of today's urban processes, questioning urban policies around the world, at the different scales, and benchmarking diverse and composite approaches to city making. \nMy interest is to keep challenging the complex urban and territorial development. I am curious about urban dynamics, co-creation, regeneration, community development processes, new urban concept in search of innovative and resourceful strategies in order to adjust planning instruments and policies accordingly. That is a bit broad but extremely fascinating. \nI currently live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where I have collaborated with the International New Town Institute (INTI) for which I have coordinated the Eu funded program \u201cNew Towns, Arrival Cities\". \nIn 2016 I was awarded the METREX Bernd Steinacher research Fellowship exploring models of metropolitan governance in the European context in dialogue with local and regional representatives. Since then she I developed my personal research on the observation of the contemporary landscapes transformation by using photography as a cultural and narrative tool for territorial analysis and community engagement, first as co-founder and author of the Urban Reports collective and later establishing the research group paesaggisensibili (www.paesaggisensibili.org) with the photographer Alessandro Guida.",

Many EU metropolitan areas and regions are striving for more functional and effective governance systems. Adopting the approach of the metropolitan antenna, this research will look at a selection of metropolitan contexts, both Italian and International, with the aim to to understand what are the models and mechanisms of metropolitan governance in place and how do they work. \nThrough a series of interviews and informal talks with a wide range of actors and stakeholders, at the different territorial scales, this exploration will lead to the elaboration of common questions and elements for reflection on the metropolitan dimension. The final objective of this research is the identification of common questions and reflections leading to knowledge exchange  and mutual learning at the European level.\n\nAbstract: This research was a journey across Europe. It was a unique chance to informally meet and talk to the policy-makers, professionals and public actors who are called today to master the complexity of the territorial dynamics at the metropolitan scale. The understanding of \"how the territorial reality can be aligned with the governance structures\" is the goal of the many efforts undertaken so far and explored in this research. Why laboratories of metropolitan governance? Whether there is a top-down legislative framework that needs to be adapted and make it fit to the local and place-specific challenges and issues (Italian cases), or a special funding programme tailor-made for a target-region (Prague), or a voluntary and pragmatic political interest to achieve cooperation and play together (Helsinki region and Lyon Metropolitan Pole), each territory showcases an attempt, a strategy, a way forward, to deal with major territorial questions that call for radical changes.",
