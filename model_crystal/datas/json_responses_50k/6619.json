    "summary": "My working life has almost always been in the commercial field, as it is now. A beautiful profession.\nBoth internally and externally I like to look at logic in the processes in order to work as pleasantly and effectively as possible. As a result I have time for nice conversations, meeting people and building long relationships.\nFeel free to add me to your network, or let me know if you think we can help each other.\n\nWith Zekerheyd we ensure effective and efficient processes in which Dutch employers no longer miss any benefits or incur unnecessary costs.\nEmployers pay unnecessarily high premiums and miss out on benefits related to wage cost benefits and sickness benefits. By analyzing this, we save avg. 0.8-2% of the wage bill and together we set up the processes in such a way that it is under control in the future.\nI would be happy to explain to you how we do this.\n\nIn addition to my work, I am also involved in research into the effect of variable remuneration on sales teams. There is a strong interface between these topics. A lot of money and energy is spent on variable remuneration, but it is unclear whether it works. Science shows it wouldn't/shouldn't work, in practice variable pay has been increasing for decades. \n\nAnd while we are talking about effectiveness; undisturbed work is nice. That's why I still have a webshop with do not disturb lights, Luxafor (the majority goes through online portals such as Bol).\n\nYou can find information about the research and the do not disturb lights at www.maver.nu.\n\nA final role (except privately of course) that I have is supervising students at Avans during their graduation. I myself studied during my work, I know the frustrations. It is nice to support them during this. This also provides great insights into other companies and processes.\n\nWant to know more about the things I'm working on, feel free to call me on 06 1334 2934.",
