    "summary": "Instrumental Teacher | Childhood Creative Education | Entrepreneur |  Musician\n\nWith over 12 years of experience, I excel in creating and imparting instrumental music programs for students aged 5-12 in the primary-school sector. My expertise includes the creation and implementation of instrumental and creative programs that meet the growing needs of 21st century child students as well as the integration of said programs within the wider vision of a primary-school's artistic, academic and social life. Apart from music and the arts, I have a passion for networking and developing strong relationships with school communities, as I believe this forms the foundation of great learning outcomes. I am currently seeking ways of extending support learning material through the use of innovative digital technologies and social media, particularly as way of supporting parents in the musical development of their child. Specific fields of interest include early-childhood pedagogy, digital technology in childhood learning processes and creative education dissemination.",
