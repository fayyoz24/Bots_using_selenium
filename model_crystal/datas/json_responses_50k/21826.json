The work intoxicates and activates visitors\u2019 visual, auditory and kinesthetic senses through the symphony of five interactive tents.\n\nA surreal adult-playground invites guests to connect with the various phases of human sexuality. The tents are designed around our visceral relationship with nature and eroticism - ranging from a girl made from grass whispering in your ear; an ice-oven tent that warms as your basal body temperature rises; enticingly tactile gloryholes; to a steamy cloud-chamber filled with the fever of scent.\n\nEdith Gruson of Droog explains the concept of the installation, \u201c..here you will experience feelings which are intensified by memories of your body and nature. How does it feel to walk through wet grass, the water embracing your body\u2026the sensation of warm and cool on your skin.\u201d\n\nThe five camping tents are designed to seduce curiosity, prompting visitors to explore the exotic thrill of arousal. Mark Snyder, Director of Exhibitions at the Museum of Sex explains; \u201cThrough our Kinesthesia Art Commission award we hope to push the boundaries of traditional Museum-going experiences and encourage patrons to appreciate physical art..expect to use your entire body when you visit Splendor in the Grass.\u201d\n\nWhether the space harnesses movement or tactility, the physical or emotional, fantasy or reality \u2013 each contemporary bivouac will, in combination, weave together the diverse sum of sexuality.",

After that they decided to continue studying, and both attended the Willem de Kooning Academie to finally graduate in Teacher fine arts. After that they both became teachers at the Grafisch Lyceum, where they have been teaching several courses up until today. Ian has been performing as a VJ ever since 2002. Early 2008 Ian and Rutger teamed up and formed Space monkeys. \n\nFor every gig they try to adapt their visuals as tight as possible depending on the theme of the night. However, they do succeed in maintaining their own distinct and contemporary style which is characterised by rich colours, freshness and friskiness. They experiment a lot with 2D and 3D and love to think way beyond the standard 3:4 screen. Rutger is the 3D graphics expert whilst Ian experiments with raw analogue ideas. They are very experimental and their biggest feature is probably their \u2018out of the box\u2019-thinking.",
