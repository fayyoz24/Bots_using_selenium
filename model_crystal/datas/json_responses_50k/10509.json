    "summary": "From the first moment that I stepped into the 35.000m2 warehouse of Schneider Electric I knew one thing: \u201cThis will be my playground for the upcoming years\u201d. The playground which would make it possible to significantly improve the current operational processes, develop myself and learn all there is to know about warehouse and project management. \n\nAll my life I have had a natural drive to be the best and look for new challenges. Due to this drive I have had the opportunity to work in various roles over the last 8 years. As a result, this has now given me the unique ability to manage complex multi-disciplinary projects and teams.  \n\nAs a Maintenance & Methods Manager today I am overseeing a team of five engineers who contributed to a 6% saving in operational efficiency last year. Our most exciting projects have been the construction and implementation of a new canteen and the implementation of a new facility management supplier which resulted in a saving of 5% and the reduction of 2 FTE in the first year. \n\nI am passionate about developing individuals and building a strong team who together are able to achieve operational excellence. As inventory manager I was able to set up the best inventory control team world wide which achieved and is still maintaining an inventory accuracy of 99.5% over the last 5 years.  \n\nI\u2019m always interested in meeting new people so feel free to contact me if you\u2019d like to connect at meikevanooijen@gmail.com. \n\nSpecialties: operational management, project management, employee development, inventory control, process improvement, purchasing, Warehouse Management System (WMS), lean warehousing, 5S, continuous improvement ",
