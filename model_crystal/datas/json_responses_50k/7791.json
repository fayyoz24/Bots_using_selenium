    "summary": "My names are Alice Mapenzi Kubo. l am a graduate of International Development Studies (M.Sc.) and my M.Sc. study at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) was awarded cumlaude. My academic work has been published (in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Polish) and is available at many online bookstores. My work as a development practitioner, for more than 10 years, focused on program management and l collaborated with a diverse group of stakeholders. l have experience forging partnerships with international, regional, national and local level organisations, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), government agencies, telecom companies, and other stakeholders. I have broad knowledge and experience in children\u2019s rights and rights-based programming, monitoring and evaluation, and participatory approaches. I have conducted desk-research and field research. And l have knowledge about education and quality of education which stems from conducting research into the subject area and also from serving in the expert group on School Fees Abolition Initiative (SFAI) that was led by UNESCO-IIEP and UNICEF. The expert group developed the Operational Guide on the process of school fees abolition and safeguarding quality of education (the Operational Guide is available online). My expertise on research techniques, data collection and data analysis comes from my academic background and also from being a Jury Member of the Africa Thesis Award (see African Studies Centre Leiden University (ASCL)). I also have knowledge about the tourism industry after pursuing a Bachelor degree and specializing in sustainable tourism and development. My knowledge of environmental management was gained from studies on environment at the University of Amsterdam and from the British Open University, as well as volunteering for a Kenyan-based organisation that focuses on conservation and environmental matters. l am open to all areas of work, be it at an NGO, research institute, public sector, the private/corporate sector or other organisations or agencies. I enjoy \u2018learning-by-doing\u2019 and l have the \u2018can-do-mentality\u2019. My ambition remains being an \u2018agent of change\u2019 and if that change is driven by a NGO, or a bank, or a foundation or a research institute, l will embrace it and contribute to its efforts in achieving its vision, mission and values, among others.
