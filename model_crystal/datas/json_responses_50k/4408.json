    "summary": "I am an ambitious and eager mathematician who recently obtained a PhD in Mathematics (Probability & Statistics).  \n\nI am looking for my dream job that I hope to start after the summer, where\n- I work in a passionate, innovative, and open-minded team,\n- we are moving quickly, leaving no time for internal politics and hidden agendas,\n- I present solutions to complex problems solutions in a simple, original way, thinking two steps ahead.\n\nBesides publishing and presenting my work (10 papers) at top-tier venues, during my PhD I mostly enjoyed\n- social interaction: visiting universities abroad and working with people from all over the world,\n- initiating and organizing a 9-day workshop (with a novel concept) for 85 researchers.\n- broadening knowledge by working on side-projects (two papers) in which we explained machine-learning algorithms.\n\nDuring my time at Air France-KLM's Operations Research Department and Coosto, I \n- tackled complex business problems by mathematical modeling (e.g. optimization, machine learning),\n- learned that writing production-ready software is at least as important as solving a mathematical problem,\n- set up a system to quickly ship Proof of Concepts to a production-ready IT-environment,\n- taught programming languages to junior colleagues, and supervised (graduate) interns.\n\nIn my free time, I play piano in several jazz bands and challenge my own boundaries with respect to biking and cooking.",

I was expecting to only publish research in high-quality theoretical journals (two papers published, two more submitted papers, all as main author). However, the COVID outbreak  led to an applied research line, with two simulation-based papers in well-known journals discussing the effects of temporary immunity and usage of contact-tracing applications. In these two projects I was the responsible person for defining research questions, setting up the experiments, and writing tested software. As side projects I have collaborated on two papers that explain how/why certain machine learning algorithms/models work, one of which was awarded with a Runner-up award at a conference.\n\nBesides doing research, I have supervised a master's student, and I have been an instructor for several courses: I have been awarded a Certificate of Excellence as an instructor for Statistical Learning Theory. I was also one of the initiators and main organisers of a 9-day workshop for 85 researchers (audience ranging from Ph.D. students to the top professors in the field). Besides running the day-to-day organization, I was responsible (together with my co-organiser) for gathering funding, inviting speakers, and communicating with attendees from all over the world.\n\nI have visited ETH Zurich and Pontificia Universidad de Chile for multiple months/weeks.",
