The current system of the customer consists of customized software and heavily customized BaaN. During the bid phase I am responsible for the Distitbution and Master Data modules. After winning the bid, we start with modeling the current processes, then we map these against the BaaN software capabilities. Next step is to develop solutions to ammend changes to the currenct processes in a way that vanilla BaaN can support these as much as possible and also estimate the costs for the new processes. This leads to the conclusion as we allready did expect and told the customer so during the bidding phase that BaaN vanilla is not the solution to aim for. This makes the customer to decide to first redesign the business processes and then start with developing a new ERP system with BaaN as backbone and with customization on top of that.",
