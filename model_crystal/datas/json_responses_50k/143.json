In my column \"In de verdediging\" I write about the research work of recently graduated PhD students in the Netherlands. My goal with my column is to communicate some modern research in mathematics to the general mathematical community. Below you can find some examples of my work \n\nhttp://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2021-22-3-192.pdf\nhttp://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2021-22-2-126.pdf\nhttp://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2021-22-1-063.pdf\nhttp://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2020-21-4-277.pdf\n\nI also enjoy doing interviews.
