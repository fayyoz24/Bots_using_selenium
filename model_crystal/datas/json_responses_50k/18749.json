    "summary": "I am passionate about leveraging new media to optimize sales and marketing efforts. I am objective-driven, creative and derive a lot of enjoyment from establishing meaningful relationships with people to work towards common goals and finding effective solutions. Having lived in the States, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia throughout my childhood, and eventually relocating to the Netherlands, I've adopted a culturally hybrid way of thinking and working.\n\nI take pride in pursuing the execution of \"big\" ideas and minimizing the margin of limitations whilst putting the client at the center of my workflow. I constantly educate, refine and push myself to use every day as a new learning day and find opportunity in every circumstance... even in the face of adversity. \n\nIn my spare time I love to travel and discover new cultures. What I enjoy most about traveling to new places is meeting new people, hearing their stores and perhaps what I find most intriguing... getting a \"taste\" of the different ways of life through food-so I always take note of new recipes to fill my cookbook with as I travel- what better way to go back to your favorite destination than to be able to recreate memories from the comfort of your own kitchen! \n\nTricycle specializes in the supporting of organizations globally through tailor-made Marketing & Sales solutions by providing B2B professionals with resources to optimize their time and sales workflows. My role as a coach focuses on fostering the digital transformations of organizations with a focus on shifting traditional sales processes to a modern way of succeeding in the digital space. This is executed through the implementation of Social Selling strategies by leveraging LinkedIn as a platform in optimizing their professional network to ultimately grow their professional and personal brand.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to me in case you'd like to connect!",
