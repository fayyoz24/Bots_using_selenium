As a teacher I was supposed to present planning for each class, prepare my students for evaluation tests, test other students and give official evaluations. The main material was Cambridge Face2Face book series for levels from A1 to C1. \nI was also selected to evaluate job applicants for TAME (airline company) and give official reports on their language skills.",
