    "summary": "As a Senior Scientist at PathoFinder, a leading company in molecular diagnostics, I apply my PhD in Bioengineering and my expertise in stem cells, CRISPR/Cas gene editing, and regenerative medicine to develop new products for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n\nWith over 8 years of experience in academic and industry research, I have contributed to multiple projects that aim to improve human health and well-being, such as creating iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for genetic testing, generating reporter stem cell lines for tissue engineering, and screening and validating diagnostic assays. I also provide support for marketing, business, and sales, assist with quality assurance and management systems, and train and supervise project teams. My mission is to use my scientific background and skills to create innovative solutions that can benefit patients and healthcare providers.",
