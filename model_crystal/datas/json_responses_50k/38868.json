    "summary": "Dear Network,\n\nFrom August 2023, after being active as Hub Manager of Innovation Hub Winterswijk for three years, I will start as Business Developer at Colubris Cleantech!\n\nFor three years, I was allowed to supervise around 100 students at Colubris Cleantech, Contour Covering Technology BV, Klein Poelhuis Bedrijven and Apparatenfabriek ARA B.V.. During this learning period, I supervised students on assignments such as implementing a cobot, creating a digital factory, improving project data storage and improving pilot units in the chemical engineering field. It was quite a challenge.\n\nIn recent years, the companies have established super-collaborations with the various ROCs, universities and HBOs in the region: Saxion University of Applied Sciences, Wageningen University & Research, Westf\u00e4lische Hochschule , Arnhem and Nijmegen University of Applied Sciences, Graafschap College, University of Twente. Many thanks for this to all cooperation partners! Bonne Jansen will take over this contact from mid-August as my successor.\n\nDuring these three years, I found out that the combination of language, technology and business administration really interests me. This comes together in Business Development.\n\nBesides continuing in this new job at Colubris Cleantech from August, I am still active as an entrepreneur for the Grenzhoppers, Grenzhoppers Business School and the GROS regiodeal project.\n\n... and, of course, I will also continue to study a bit of Spanish ;)\n\nI am already looking forward to it!",

From a simple screen to the integration of the most advanced technologies aimed to generate value from waste. From idea to turnkey realization. \n\nWithin Colubris Cleantech, I counsel students in Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics, Technical Business Administration and Environmental Technology. The students researched processes and products. New units were designed and existing units redesigned. In addition, Applied Research supports Colubris' R&D team with their research. For instance, several studies have also been conducted on purifying water with new techniques. From lab tests to pilot tests. I supervised the students within Contour on a 'general' level. This involved checking reports, studying subjects in depth and keeping in touch with colleges and universities.\n\nBesides supervising students, I built a full Academy for Colubris with a training programme. Through surveys and a lot of contact with colleagues, a training programme has been set up to bring all colleagues up to a good level in the Water Solutions, Waste Solutions and Bioresource Solutions divisions.",

The aim of the network was to connect cross-border initiatives, share knowledge and get to know each other. The network, which in 2016 consisted mainly of employees of municipalities, has grown into a bi-national meeting platform of entrepreneurs, employees from the culture and tourism sector and government institutions and now has more than 600 members. Grenzhoppers is now a foundation and the networking platform from which numerous cross-border initiatives arise and will celebrate its first anniversary in 2021.  \n\nIn 2019, I started as an intern under Public Relations.

Each hub has its own hub manager - funded by the hub's companies. He/she is responsible for recruiting, selecting and supervising students and continuing knowledge development.\n\nCurrently, there are six stand-alone Innovation Hubs in the province of Gelderland (epicentre is the Achterhoek and Liemers region). At those hubs, between 200 and 220 students per year find innovative (internship) assignments.\n\nSince September 2020, I started working at Innovation Hub Winterswijk- Aalten.  This is a cooperation between Colubris Cleantech, Contour Covering Technology, ARA Apparatenfabriek and Klein Poelhuis Installatietechniek. At the time, this was still a new Innovation Hub. Within the various affiliated companies, it was my job to look for internship and graduation assignments, define them and eventually find students for them. \n\nAs of February 2021, around 60 students with backgrounds in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Embedded Systems, Chemical Engineering, Business Administration, Marketing and other backgrounds have been supervised. These students were supervised within Colubris Cleantech, Contour Covering Technology, ARA Apparatenfabriek and Klein Poelhuis Installatietechniek.",
