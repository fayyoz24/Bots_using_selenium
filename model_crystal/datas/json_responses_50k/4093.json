    "summary": "My name is Hugo Luijnenburg, I graduated Exersice Therapy / Cesar therapy in the spring of 2011.\nAfter graduation I decided to look for specific areas of work where I felt passionate about.  \nI registered myself at a employment agency to find something nice and to explore a lot of different options. During this time I developed a great interest in media, IT and on the other side I developed a great passion for coffee, food & hospitality. \nDuring my work I am giving myself fully to achieve some goal to keep myself mentally challenged. The last years I have noticed that being aware of your mental state will benefit you greatly in the things that you are doing. There is always something to learn and there is always something to work for. We are responsible for our own success in life and staying positive and being nice to people has provided me with many meaningfull connections and knowledge that I can bring to a team!",
