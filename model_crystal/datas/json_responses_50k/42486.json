    "summary": "Hello! My name is Anastasia, a high-performing visual communication expert and creative manager. \n\nFor 10+ years, I am passionately dealing with design challenges in a broad variety of brands and industries. I designed for theme parks, real estate corporations, sustainability firm, crypto trading startup, museums, power skills edtech scaleup, game designers, lifestyle bloggers, magicians and many more.\n\nBeing a result-driven creative, I am fond of putting things in order conceptually and in practice. I enjoy creating holistic visual systems, strive to develop well-rounded design solutions, establish effective scalable processes and present the team work outcomes through visually compelling reporting tools. Funny and surprising things as much as research and theory are equally valuable for me. \n\nAlways open to new knowledge and cannot diminish my curiosity about life and its diverse aspects.\nhttps://anastasiasukhova.com/",
