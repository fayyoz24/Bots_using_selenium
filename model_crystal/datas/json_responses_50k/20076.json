    "summary": "Bachelor's degree in Mass communication (Journalist), and Lawyer with extensive intercultural experience.\n \nMy international experience comes from the time I have lived in Italy, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Spain, and The Netherlands since 2020, which allows me to understand cultural diversity very well. \n\n This multicultural experience has been helping me evaluate and rationalize situations from different points of view; furthermore, it has been helping me become a person with great social empathy. It also gives me a sense of motivation and cooperation with people, which is indispensable in the dynamics of teamwork and essential to achieving and exceeding objectives and goals.\n\n In every position that I worked, there was an opportunity to learn and improve as an individual, professional, and team member.\n \n I have a proven track record of sound business judgment, expanding accountability, and achievement across multiple functions inherent to a business throughout my professional career. I am a well-organized, dependable professional with a solid personal and business ethic. \n \n I have Venezuelan and Spanish nationality. Mother and wife; for the past 13 years, my family has been my engine of life.\n \n All in all, accompanying my husband in his works in charming places enriched me as a woman, wife, and mother in an invaluable way.",
