In 2011 he is inscribed as \"Register Constructeur\" RC at Constructeursregister (www.constructeursregister.nl; license 546). From 2014 involved in the assesment of several existing buildings with the goal to determine if they are suitable for rebuilding them into a general practice.\n\nSpecialties: Structural design of civil structures in concrete, steel and wood.\nFeasability studies, alternative studies.\nRisk based assesment of structural safety for civil structures.",
