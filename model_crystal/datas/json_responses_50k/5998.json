The connected array is chosen as the antenna solution to fulfil the requirements: fully planar, broadband and electrically steerable. Fundamental studies on the antenna dimensions, input impedance and efficiency in terms of surface waves are carried out and traded-off in order to satisfy the requirements of the instrument whilst conforming to the manufacturing constraints and the optical front-end of the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in Chile, where MOSAIC will be eventually installed. Among the plethora of options, some of the proposed set-ups in this thesis will stand out as more appropriate candidates for the instrument. Aiming at developing a first prototype of MOSAIC, a reduced-bandwidth antenna is investigated with one of the most promising set-ups previously studied. More realistic structures accounting for the finiteness of the antenna and including the actual feeding network are investigated in order to provide considerations on the final design to be manufactured.\n\n[1] https://www.sron.nl/news-mainmenu-588/press-releases-mainmenu-686/4099-millions-for-intermediate-black-holes-and-ground-breaking-redshift-machine\n",

My work on the framework on this project is to design the building blocks, i.e. the electrically-steered antenna and the MKID filterbank attached to it. Once the system is fully tested and working, it will be installed in a sub-mm telescope like ASTE (Chile). From there, MOSAIC will be able to unveil the secrets of the Early Universe, when stars were forming.\n\nThis position is funded by the ERC consolidator Grant 648135 awarded to Prof. dr. ir. J. J. A.

These ADLs, attached on top of an integrated (planar) antenna enable high front-to-back ratios whilst avoiding the problem of substrate modes (surface waves).\n\nFrom a study on the effects of the fabrication tolerances of ADLs we discovered that interleaving, instead of stacking well-aligned layers of ADL, helps to further increase the realizable effective permittivity of conventional ADLs. This effect stems from the extra capacitance rendered between inter-layer patches. This discovery enables chiefly two possibilities for ADLs: 1) reduce the number of layers required to realise a certain effective permittivity or 2) push the limits for the achievable effective permittivities.",
