This included everything from driving my coachees to their appointments with the local authorities, doing research on the internet about naturalisation procedures, making inquiries about application procedures by email and phone, and visiting open days at schools and unis to inquire into possible future courses and studies. At Taal aan Zee I also gave a workshop about job interviews and applying for jobs in the Netherlands. \n\nI purposely chose this particular type of voluntary work as I find it very important to become involved in helping those who have come from so far to make this their new home. Due to my new job I officially stepped out of volunteering since september even though I unofficially maintain contact with my coachees to this day."
