Two aspects of the process flow of C-ITS services were considered for this project and research. From the end-user acceptance view, a survey had been designed to understand how C-ITS users are thinking about these new technologies. The physical layer of the communication technology is discussed in terms of performance comparison parameters along with the operation modes that will suit the best. It was found that the 5G-New Radio physical layer provided the best performance results. The aspect of human behavior and end-user opinion after the implementation of C-ITS services was further analyzed through the means of a questionnaire.",

Once the model and the controller have been identified, we compare the estimated models and validate the model to the actual output data from the experiment. This case study concerns data collected from a  laboratory-scale \"hairdryer\". The process works as follows: Air is fanned through a duct and heated at the inlet. The air temperature is measured by a thermocouple at the outlet. The input is the voltage over the heating device,  which is just a  mesh of resistor wires.  The output is the outlet air temperature represented by the measured thermocouple voltage.",

They can range in size from massive \"full\" gantry cranes capable of lifting some of the world's biggest loads to small shop cranes used for operations like removing automotive engines. The main purpose of this project is to model a Gantry Crane, which is useful in ports since there are a  lot of goods that need to be constructed,  carried,  and transferred from one container to another, necessitating the use of large cranes. Some factors are not considered, such as ambient temperatures and disturbances that could alter the cart's movement",

The exemplary route sections to be depicted in the model will address the digital test field of the logistic park. Modeling the necessary technical components in a simulated environment and the simulation of CAT functions will help to analyze the potential impacts of CAT.",
