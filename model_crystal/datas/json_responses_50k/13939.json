    "summary": "Curiosity has always played an intricate role in my life. For as long as I can remember I have been asking questions. When I was a child I used to bug my parents with all kinds of questions, ranging from the color of the sky to why potatoes taste differently than strawberries. This curiosity-driven way of thinking has been the core of my career path.\n\nI started to satisfy my need for answers in high school when I took a particular interest in physics. This interest grew into more than just a hobby when I completed my master's degree in physics at the University of Amsterdam. Up until this point the questions I asked usually had answers, but I wanted to find the answers to questions that did not have one. Thus I decided to start my Ph.D. in experimental physics at the Advanced Research Centre for Nanolithography (ARCNL). I have come to learn whilst doing a Ph.D. that problems arise daily in the lab and in general. Solving and overcoming these problems is not always easy but I have come to appreciate this process deeply. Finding the answers to questions nobody knows the answers to by working with cutting edge technology and brilliant people is something that I love to do.\n\nBy working closely together with lithography giant ASML during my Ph.D., I have seen and experienced a merger between fundamental science and revenue-oriented business. I have come to appreciate this way of working, which is why I continued my career at ASML after finishing my Ph.D.\n\nIn my (future) career, I want to apply my curiosity-driven search for answers and my scientific skills in the industry. In a place/position where I can contribute in a team to solving today's and tomorrow's problems, whatever they may be.",

We built and improved on a setup which is capable\nof performing destructive pump-probe measurement on a single shot basis using a rapidly rotating\ngalvo mirror. To do these destructive pump-probe measurements, a femtosecond ultrafast laser\nis used with a central wavelength of 800 nm, which can be tuned, using a traveling wave optical\nparametric amplification system, to a wavelength range of 1.2-2.4 um. In this project we created, partially from scratch, the setup to do this. Furthermore, preliminary destructive pump-probe measurements were performed on \fnano structured thin Sn layers. The pump induced optical\ntransmission change was measured versus varying pump pulse energy and versus the thickness of the\nSn layer. It is shown that the optically induced transmission change undergoes transient dynamics\nin the (sub-)picosecond time domain.",

            "description": "The goal of this project was to design, create and characterize a Bessel beam. The properties of a quasi-Bessel beam allow the laser to be used as a very elongated dipole trap for implementation of continuous evaporative cooling. This continuous evaporative cooling is of crucial importance for the creation of a continuous atom laser. To create a Bessel beam a Gaussian beam is sent onto an axicon. Due to the imperfections on the axicon tip, center lobe intensity modulations are present. To remove these axial modulations, a spatial filter was implemented. The quasi-Bessel beam is characterized with and without this spatial filter. It is shown that the axial intensity modulation is suppressed as a direct consequence of the filter.\n\nUnder supervision of Chun-Chia Chen MSc. and Prof. Dr. Florian E. Schreck",

            "description": "To determine the fine structure constant, one of the fundamental constants of nature, helium atoms are trapped in a \"Magneto Optical trap\" (MOT), which is an atomic trap consistent of a magnetic trap combined with an optical trap. The helium atoms are fired from a source and go trough a 2-meter tube (Zeeman slower), where they are slowed down sufficiently enough to be trapped in the MOT. However, the helium atoms originating from the source are diverging, since the distance between the source and the MOT is approximately 3 meters the divergence of the atomic beam is devastating for the amount of helium atoms that reach the MOT. Therefore the helium atoms needed to be compressed, or collimated, directly after they leave the source. This is where I came in, by using laser light with a wavelength of 1064 nm it is possible to give the helium atoms a little push. If this push is carefully implemented from 4 sides orthogonal to the direction of movement, the atomic beam is compressed. By doing this I was able to increase the signal after Zeeman slower by a factor of 11. Which means that more atoms will be captured in the MOT.\n\nUnder supervision of Ruud van der Beek MSc. and Dr. Wim Vassen",
