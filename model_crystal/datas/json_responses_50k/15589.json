    "summary": "I am a half-English, half-Dutch pragmatic idealist; a romantic utilitarian and a reluctant politician. I can be described as an emotionally articulate Aspergian, a 27-year old child who\u2019s mature for his age, and an obsessive perfectionist who somehow intends to become a Homo Universalis \u2013 someone who metaphorically cannot sit still, but brings most of his ideas to life behind a desk.\n\nDrive\nI have been lucky enough to have excitement be the driving force behind everything I do. I have never been interested in money or susceptible to peer pressure \u2013 even when it might have been useful. Fortunately, our world is fascinating and fundamentally beautiful. My mission is to help as many people as possible to recognise that and to protect that state of things.\n\nInterests\nI have a very wide range of interests: I have developed a variant of chess in which players can hit their own pieces to combine them into stronger ones; drafted a script for a Lord of the Rings parody set in 16th century Frisia; developed a qualitatively appealing theory modifying Einsteinian gravity which turned out to fit with recent cosmological discoveries; written an epic fantasy novel about a world of my own creation, and learned cartography to create maps of it; and I am currently working on a number of non-fiction books and a browser game. I enjoy exploring new areas of natural beauty, and you will almost always find me there camera in hand. \n\nWork\nMy professional experience is still varied, but less so. Excluding an evening washing dishes at which I failed miserably, and a rather successful and enjoyable summer of 2013 programming devices for assembly lines, all my experience is in politics and education. I have managed to revitalise the youth organisation of the Party for the Animals. Its membership almost doubled, and its volunteerbase quadrupled, in the time that I was chairman. People became excited to be a part of it, just as my pupils became excited by science and abstract mathematics during the three years I taught at an international school.",

A friend instructed me to create a character to play with, which seemed to require a history for him to know, a pantheon for him to worship, and a society for him to have been a part of. Before I knew it, I had built another world.\n\nAponto Amtir has a long history that seems to have exploded forth from the ether, with no pre-history to ground it in reality. Its beings are unsure about their place in the world; none of the flaura or fauna appear naturalised or settled; and the forceful arrow of time is about the only foundation on which individuals, peoples and empires attempt to form expectations of what is to come.\n\nI am currently Dungeon Master (DM) for several groups, running seperate campaigns in the same world, and am developing a number of adventures which others could also use.",

Every area of knowledge and field of study relies on the critical, logical and creative thinking students can acquire through learning mathematics. Yet, students can\u2019t see the point of the subject, and that\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\nOur aim as maths teachers should not be to have an answer ready when students ask what the point of maths is, our aim should be to prevent them ever feeling the need to ask the question.\n\nBased on material developed and ammended throughout three years of teaching I am writing a mathematics book, which will cover every secondary school curriculum of the Netherlands and the IB MYP, but in a meaningful, possibly inspiring and hopefully enjoyable way.\n\nThe book will be divided into sections on numbers, algebra, analysis, calculus, sequences, geometry, trigonometry, probability and statistics. Students can move through these topics in various ways, based on what peaks their interest.\n\nI am looking to work together with a publishing house which specialises in educational material to turn this project into a product which is suitable for the market. This is mainly a matter of graphic design and insight into commercial viability of particular physical features I would like the book to have.",

The longer peace is maintained between countries, the more surprising a sudden choice to compete would be, and larger the reward. To avoid this temptation, countries can draft treaties, declarations and open channels of communication to maintain trust. Meanwhile, they can invest in developmental factors in which a similar choice between cooperation and competition presents itself, and internal politics also presents players with a stream of variations on the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\n\nI would be very glad to work with others on the development of this game. I have very little programming experience, and am a complete graphic autodidact. The project is potentially huge, but I have identified several sensible phases of development, the first of which could be easily achieved.",

When something happens that disturbs the certainties of the kU, they have no past experiences or understanding on which to base their response. The terrible things that occur, which they can neither distinguish nor comprehend, they simply label \u2018badness\u2019. As more and more of the society kU have created is infected by badness, the question arises whether there is anything in the nature of the kU that will allow them to confront and overcome this bizarre new aspect of their world.\n\nI am currently in the process of rewriting the book, after learning more about the world it is set in and discovering that things could not have happened as I had assumed they would have in the first telling.
