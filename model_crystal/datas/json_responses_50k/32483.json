    "summary": "Hi! I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Amsterdam in Artificial Intelligence. I did my BSc in Artificial Intelligence Judicium Cum Laude, and with Honours, at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. I'm super passionate about expanding our collective knowledge and communicating it clearly to those who need to know about it!\n\nHaving a very, \ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude3a, wide range of interests, artificial intelligence was the only field that granted me the fluidity to quench my thirst. Excited about mathematics, computer science, formal logic, cognition, linguistics, philosophy, music theory, physics, (I could go on...), I believe wholeheartedly in interdisciplinary research, and its necessity in science and society.\n\nI'm a dedicated learner and creative researcher, and adore working with other enthusiastic professionals in the most diverse of fields. I like pushing boundaries to see how far they stretch, both of my work and my own. I am just beginning my career, but am moderately experienced in research and industry, having already done several technical projects and jobs. \ud835\ude10\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude31\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2e \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26, \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude29!\n\nI also am an avid communicator of all this, having given a number of workshops and authored peer-reviewed articles. It is my long-term goal to make a difference and leave a positive mark on peoples' lives. I aim to make sure that the breakthroughs that research makes, reach the people who can take advantage of them best.\n\nOn the less-academic-non-science-y side, I have been part of several cultural and non-profit/volunteering organizations, as a leader and an active team member. More generally, I enjoy meeting and learning about new and interesting people and cultures. I am also a trained classical pianist, and love philosophy, the fine arts, jazz (\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude36\ud835\ude31 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude2b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2e!), biking, cooking, and travelling.\n\nIf you'd like to connect with me directly, shoot me an email at \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude01.\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf7\ud835\uddf6@\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9.\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa",

The competition invites teams to propose a high-energy physics experiment, given certain limitations and equipment. We competed in BL4S 2018 against 195 teams from 42 countries and won a fully-sponsored trip to Geneva, Switzerland. We were the first Asian winners of the competition. Over a span of 15 days, we executed our experiment at the T9 Beamline of the Proton Synchotron complex. Over the next two years we wrote and published a paper in World Scientific's The Physics Educator to further physics education.\n\n> Studied the behaviour of high-energy charged subatomic particles under the influence of strong magnetic fields and heuristically derived the relativistic Lorentz equation for charged particles in order to understand the implications of a purely data-driven approach to physics. \n> Worked with instrumentation such as Delay Wire Chambers, micro-mesh gaseous structure detectors, scintillators, collimators and high-energy electromagnets.\n> Performed data analysis which included three-dimensional particle track reconstruction and time-of-flight analysis using CERN's modular scientific software framework ROOT, based in C/C++.",
