    "summary": "Understanding and modelling \u201cwater\u201d is of great importance: water is essential for life, but also forms a risk for huge parts of the World, especially under climate change.\n\nIn my current position as Senior Developer at Fathom and post-doctoral researcher at the Utrecht University, I am making use of my hydrological and programming to research the impact of water on society. This encompasses work related to modelling precipitation intensities, flood risk and \"hyper-resolution hydrology\" as well work dedicated to assessing the impact of climate change on the interplay between hydro-meteorology and society.",

Using Machine Learning techniques will allow for making projections of conflict-prone areas under future conditions.",
