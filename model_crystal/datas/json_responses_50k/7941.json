    "summary": "I am a first year Masters student at KU Leuven, Belgium. Much of my previous education has been spent in Mumbai, India, Brussels, Belgium and Utrecht, Netherlands. Growing up in these cities, and my recent completion of my studies in the Netherlands has allowed me to experience life as a global, multicultural student.  \n\n----\nAn opportunity is an experience and I am grateful that throughout the years I have either grasped at or created opportunities to hone my skills, and develop new ones. I love to learn and given the flexibility of my curriculum at the University College Utrecht, I was glad to further my interests in the Medical Sciences whilst also pursuing Linguistics as a minor. Now, I take it a step further by pursuing a Masters in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven that not only helps me grow as a biomedical researcher, but also gives me the freedom to explore the research interests in this field. \n\nI enjoy bringing a community together, and as such have actively involved myself in both the organization and execution of different events. These have ranged from charity events such as online art projects and running a pin store, or creating a sense of community through the choir.\n\nI continue to develop my interests in languages and the visual arts through self-study and drawing in my free time.",
