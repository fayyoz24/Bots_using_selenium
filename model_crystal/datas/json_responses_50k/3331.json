Households solutions available for these challenges are very limited. MENA region is already dealing with limited water access and dependency on saltwater desalination, high-reliance on food imports, and severely polluted air, and its situation will be severely aggravated. \nFlowhack tackles these challenges from a human-centric perspective  offering households decentralised water generation services, digitized air and water purification along with  real-time quality control and personalized food supplement supply through water. One device can meet a household\u2019s drinking water requirements. \nFlowhack will use \u201cTom\u2019s social entrepreneurship model\u201d (Get water, give water) to impact the base of the pyramid too. The initiative will leverage existing low-cost harvesters of atmospheric water and develop solutions for agriculture gradually.\nThis household device harvests water out of thin-air and can customized the nutritional microcomponents of the water according to the personal needs of the in-taker. Real-time water and air data is captured by sensors in the device. Additional data on nutritional specific individual requirements are collected through a vitamin and mineral wearable tracker. Algorithms are used to support the customer data analysis. Then personalized insights & recommendations are provided through digital interfaces creating an entirely new experience for water consumption, vitamin intake and air monitoring.\nThis decentralized solution increases resilience of households to deal with air, water and nutritional challenges exacerbated by Climate Change, and makes legacy solutions redundant, reducing the use of bottled-water, the impact of plastic and brine in oceans and capital for water infrastructure.\n",
