They will work in mixed teams on a cross-media case from the industry. Media companies provide the MFW participants with a case or problem. During the week, the participants work on these cases and present a solution at the end of the week. Amongst others, there will be cases about multi screen applications and about smart societies.\" \n\nDuring this week I work as a facilitator of one of the project-teams.

I'd love to work in Fablabs and experiment in creative sessions. Get something going on!\nTake a look at some recent projects at our Facebook page! https://www.facebook.com/StudiovanderSar \n\nAnd please, get in touch. I'd love to talk about my ambition to change the way we create, design, make and educate people to do so. If it helps we can make 3D printing the talking subject and I bring my 3D printers (and knowledge) to you!",

The need from students to get to know each other and to meet businesses remained thereby unanswered. I feeled honoured to make that happen. And with the help of a lot of students, teachers and employees within some months a real study association has been set up. The notary on 9 April made it entirely complete. On the 10th of April we celebrated the official association.",

The purpose of this visit was to see the results of the work Right To Play does in the field and create awareness with the Dutch people. Manon was selected from a large group of applicants for this trip. Her job was to make a videofilm of the trip and after our return to The Netherlands give presentations to schools. During the trip I got the opportunity to get to know Manon better. She is a nice dedicated person with a good sense of humour. Manon is able to balance business and fun. The videofilm she made was great and of good quality. It will be used by us for presentations. I am glad that I have been able to work with her and am very happy that she signed up to become a volunteer for Right To Play.\"\n\nMay 22, 2009, Matthijs managed Manon indirectly as currect director at Right To Play"

In 2013 I bought my first own 3D printer, in 2014 I built my second personal printer (Prusa i3) and I'm enjoying these new possibilities. I try to help out other organisations with this technique and the changing ways to educate people. For 3D Hubs I organize several events in 's Hertogenbosch to set-up a local 3D community. "
