    "summary": "Mark Voskuijl is Full Professor Weapon and Aviation Systems at the faculty of Military Sciences at the Netherlands Defence Academy since September 2018. Mark Voskuijl is a specialist in the field of flight performance, stability and control of both fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft. He is the (co)author of about 50 relevant publications (journals, book chapters, conference papers, patents).\n\nFrom 2007 until 2018, Mark was Assistant Professor Flight Mechanics at the Flight Performance and Propulsion Group of Delft University of Technology. There he was responsible for lectures, projects and final thesis work related to flight performance and was coordinator of the Master track Flight Performance and Propulsion.\n\nBefore joining Delft University, Mark completed his PhD at the Flight Science and Technology research group of the University of Liverpool within the 'helicopter active control technology' project, which focused on the benefits of novel active control concepts, applied to the mutual improvement of handling qualities, flight envelope protection and structural load alleviation for helicopters. This project involved close collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada. Extensive use was made of their advanced systems research aircraft, a fly-by-wire Bell 412 helicopter.\n\nMark's interest and passion for the field of a\nflight performance, stability and control was originally sparked by work placements as a graduate student at the handling qualities department of Boeing Helicopters and the helicopters and aeroacoustics department of the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR)\n\n\nSpecialties: \nAircraft performance\nStability and control\nHelicopter flight dynamics\nLoad alleviation\nFlight Control\nAircraft Design",

SABRE will help Europe achieve its ambitious aviation emissions goals while also sharpening its competitive edge in the rapidly growing international helicopter market. It will achieve this ambitious objective by removing one of the most fundamental limitations on helicopter performance: the need for rotor blades to have a single fixed geometry which is inherently a compromise between widely different operating conditions. SABRE envisions shape adaptive blades which can continuously change their shape to optimise performance in all conditions.",
