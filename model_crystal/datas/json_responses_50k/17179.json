    "summary": "A film director with versatile experience born in Belgrade, currently living in Rotterdam. First feature-length film, a documentary called Gora screened at Visions du Reel in Nyon, Switzerland. Gora portrays an isolated shepherd community in the harsh mountains of Kosovo through a unique post-anthropocentric filmmaking style, where animals and nature are put on the same level as personal stories of the people.\n\nThe success of Gora was followed by Mamonga, a feature fiction film dealing with problems of miscommunication in three generations of three Balkan countries. Mamonga premiered at Karlovy Vary, screened at New Horizons and Marrakech Film Festival, among other festivals.\n\nBoth films were mentored by Bela Tarr during the course of PhD filmmaking studies in the film.factory program in Sarajevo. In between films directed a dozen of commercials, music videos and experimental videos for installations and theater.\n\nCurrently working on a feature-length fiction adaptation of a Slavic pagan folk tale dealing with destiny and belonging.\n\nBefore directing films and after obtaining a bachelor degree in sound design, worked many years as a soundman, through personal projects as well as a hired gun.\n\nAs the Head of Cinema at De Balie in Amsterdam, he selects films for daily programming as well as specials. He tries to find a fine balance between socially important and cinematically impressive films. His ideal is to have a regular audience that can connect the films shown into a whole larger than the parts. The films in the specials are always placed in a broader context and the following conversations often only use the film as an entry point into a deeper conversation.",
