    "summary": "Passionate about ecological design thinking and dedicated to fostering sustainable practices, I am on a journey to explore solutions that place Life at the centre. With a background in Philosophy and Geopolitics, I bring Whole-System's Design Thinking to create a positive impact. Currently pursuing my MA in Ecological Design Thinking at Schumacher College, I am excited to expand my knowledge and contribute to shaping a future that embraces regenerative practices.\n\nThroughout my journey, I have engaged with diverse projects, communities, and organizations rooted in regenerative functioning. These experiences have provided valuable insights into alternative cultural, infrastructural, economic, agricultural, and governmental models, all while nurturing my deep understanding of interconnectedness.\n\nWith a solid foundation in Western Liberal Arts & Culture and Global Studies, I have gained rich insights into the history and thought supporting our systems. I have also developed skills in systemic thinking, interdisciplinary research, and an understanding of major environmental and economic discourses/agendas.\n\nThe next step in my journey, I have the pleasure to join Schumacher College for the MA Ecological Design Thinking. What else awaits next to that is still unknown. I look forward to continue learning, exchanging, and supporting Life. \n\nLet us design a future which hold Life at the centre!\n\nAs Thomas Huebl states:\n\"The energy of intense suffering is pushed out of consciousness simply so that life can be allowed to go on. Denial permits us to survive the unsurvivable\u2014for a while.\u201d (Healing Collective Trauma, 2020)\n\nWell, it has been quite a while..! It is time to change.",

In 2022, Maastricht will be at the heart of the conversation on the future of Europe, and the G30 will be one of its driving forces.\u202f \n\nThe G30 initiative aims to empower the next generation of thinkers and creatives to get actively involved in building up the future of the EU and its democratic foundations. The thirty members of the G30 represent the diversity of Maastricht University, which similarly exists in the European community. They work together to produce a creative piece of work. This piece of work will present their ideas and vision of Europe\u2019s future and it will be publicly exhibited in May 2022. They will not work on this alone: G30 is all about working towards a better Europe together. They will meet with politicians, policymakers, and thought leaders who will provide them with an abundance of knowledge and insights.\"",
