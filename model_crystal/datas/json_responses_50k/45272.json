    "summary": "Hi there! I am a front-end developer with experience in UX design, design systems and prototyping. After a detour doing design operations, I am excited to return to front-end development and apply my skills to create intuitive and accessible experiences.\n\nWith over 4.5 years of experience in product development, I am motivated to grow quickly into a senior front-end role, preferably at a mission-driven organization or working on forward-thinking projects.\n\nI am currently deepening my CSS knowledge and I am excited to explore the possibilities of some Web APIs like Canvas & WebGL next, and maybe dive into interactive data visualization after. I recently returned from a long trip, and I'm now actively looking for new opportunities.\n\nIn my personal life I enjoy outdoor activities, (audio)books, and trying new things. My background is in physics and biomedical engineering.",
