The applications for each production station were developed in C# in the .Net 5 framework, and communication with embedded systems was solved using OPC UA. The database for the production system was developed using Microsoft SQL; furthermore, a dashboard for production tracking is currently developed using React, Express and MongoDB. The product received certification in early 2021 for production.\n\nOther projects included:\n-Development of a control system for the client's new quality and safety testing machinery.\n-Design and integration of HMI interfaces for existing machinery and other devices.\n-Creating communication between different production platforms for a more streamlined production process.",

My role was to apply Finite Element Methods to optimize the structures for weight in static conditions.\n\nFurthermore, I have participated in the culmination of Low8, a project with an aim of bringing the next generation of composite pressure vessels to market. I had the opportunity to visit a Malaysian production plant that produces Low8 cylinders, in order to design upgrades to the quality and fatigue testing areas of the production line. \n\nI have also taken part in the design and validation of a of a cryogenic double walled tank for LNG transportation.",

Consequently, I gained a better understanding on how an engineered product is created, and what difficulties can occur when a design is not feasible for production. Also, it showed me, how a design should have the balance between low-cost and innovation.",
