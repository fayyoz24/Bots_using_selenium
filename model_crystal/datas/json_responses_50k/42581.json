I cannot tell you how many\ntimes I\u2019ve spoken with \u201cwannabe online marketers\u201d who just don\u2019t get this! Some of the\nmost respected authorities online don\u2019t even get this. Which is exactly why so many\ntech guys, web designers, programmers and some of the most Internet savvy people\nnever crack making the big bucks.\nMany people we\u2019ve worked with over the years do actually understand the concept of\nhaving a funnel, but just don\u2019t have the time, money, skills or resources to put one in\nplace. This is why Jay and I came up with the SFM Business System in the first place.\nWe realized that if we could solve that problem for our students, we would effectively be\nhanding them the keys to their new \u201cDigital Lifestyle\u201d, with our franchise-like model\nremoving many of the variables that typically hold people back.\nIt\u2019s easy to dive into the spirit of things and get overexcited when your list starts filling\nup. However you might end up falling into the trap of trying to oversell your list. Bear in\nmind that you don't want your subscribers to get tired of you, or burnt out, so it\u2019s\nimportant to pace your marketing. Intersperse sales messages with news, information or\nother email content to prevent your list from feeling bombarded with sales pitches. You\nwant to be seen as a friendly, trusted advisor. Keep your list happy with great deals and\ninteresting info so you can have a willingly captive audience that keeps on growing for\nlife. And again, we will do this with you, so that you\u2019re confident in walking the right\nbalance between sales and providing value.",
