    "summary": "Dr. Keenan A, Ramsey is an early career researcher focused on public health who recently obtained her Doctor of Philosphy (PhD) from the Vrije Universitiet (VU) Amsterdam (Amsterdam, the Netherlands).\n\nDr. Ramsey was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City (USA). From an early age, she exhibited intellectual curiosity, which was fostered and developed at The Dalton School. She went on to pursue and obtain her Bachelor of Science in Public Health with a Minor in Philosophy from the Tulane University School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine (New Orleans, USA). To broaden her horizons, during her undergraduate career, Dr. Ramsey studied and lived abroad. In 2015 she traveled to Nicosia, Cyprus to study at the University of Nicosia and in 2017 to Amsterdam, the Netherlands to study at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. Parallel to her coursework, she sought out opportunities for further enrichment, which inspired her to conduct research in different areas of the health sciences throughout her undergraduate career, including, behavioural and addiction medicine research at the University of California Los Angeles, immunology laboratory research at Tulane School of Medicine, and research in health disparities at the University of Southern California.\n\nAfter graduating from Tulane in 2017, in 2018, Dr. Ramsey was awarded a fellowship by the European Union\u2019s 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie-Sklodowska-Curie Actions to pursue her PhD at the VU Amsterdam as a part of the interdisciplinary Physical Activity and Nutritional Influences in Ageing Consortium. During her PhD she was awarded a grant by the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Science\u2019s (FGB) to visit The University of Melbourne (Australia) and collect data at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. Dr. Ramsey's PhD dissertation marks the culmination of a rigorous PhD trajectory, including 10 of the 17 research articles she has authored to date, which she defended on November 1st, 2021 and received a PhD from the FGB of the VU Amsterdam.\n\nDr. Ramsey is devoted to a future invested in health and research. Her career is motivated by her\nmission to harvest and apply evidenced based knowledge to enhance the health of individuals,\ncommunities, and societies by the promotion of healthy lifestyle and prevention of disease through research, community engagement, and policy. She is committed to the pursuit of health equity by grounding research in social responsibility with emphasis on the values of diversity and inclusion, social justice, and equal access and opportunity for health and to healthcare.",
