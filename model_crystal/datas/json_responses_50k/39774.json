    "summary": "Works independently, creates overview, makes choices easily, strong planner, therefore often acts in a coordinating role. \u2709\ufe0f FEC.Venema@gmail.com\n\nI am inquisitive, driven and solution-orientated, and eager for new opportunities. Being a real go-getter, I do not give up easily (my educational background is an example of this). Loyalty and finishing what I started are important values for me. In addition, I am entrepreneurial and I enjoy a good challenge (I completed the last two years of my pre-university education in just one year). To develop myself continuously is very important to me. Furthermore, my studies and broad interests make me versatile.\n\nNow that I have finished my bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s at the University of Amsterdam, I am ready for a new challenge and looking forward to put my knowledge into practice (though I am never ready with learning). \n\nExtra-curricular activities during my studies and the 6 months studying abroad brought me additional skills. The work for the Intree Committee of UvA taught me to work strategically and brought me good networking skills. During my time as an Exchange Ambassador I found out that planning and organizing are perfect for me. I am someone who plans five steps ahead, thinks critically, collecting and weighing all options, before making a decision.\n\nIn group projects during my studies it quickly became clear that I am the generalist with an eye for detail. I easily keep the overview and I often by nature act in a coordinating role.\n\nIn the second year of my bachelor I took the opportunity to study abroad for six months at the University of Exeter, a nice and educational experience. I did my entire study in English, but during the semester in England I especially developed good communication skills in English (verbally as well as in writing). Furthermore, this experience made me more confident, even in strange or new environments.\n\nI have developed many skills and I am currently putting them into practice at PNO Consultants as an Innovation  consultant!",

To ensure that this knowledge of technological developments in the market is up-to-date and to digitize supervision, DNB has drawn up a digital strategy: to become a smart supervisor. This is to be able to anticipate on these developments in a timely manner, for example to quickly identify new risks and to intervene. At the same time, the application of advanced data & analytics techniques offers opportunities for both DNB's supervision and applications in the financial sector. As a junior change manager, I help realize this digital strategy and innovate supervision!\n\nThe Young Professional Program includes assignments in 3 departments over a period of 2 years. The assignments vary from helping supervision teams with new digital tools, further shaping of the applications developed by DNB in a creative way to thinking along about strategic issues related to the digitization of supervision.",
