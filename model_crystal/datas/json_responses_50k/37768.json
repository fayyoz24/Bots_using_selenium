    "summary": "I\u2019m an independent interim manager, non-executive and coach with a specific focus on Africa and conservation. \n\nMainly as a board member, I\u2019m currently involved in several NGO\u2019s. I'm the chairperson of the Foundation for Rural Energy Services (www.fres.nl). FRES supports SDG related development in rural areas of Africa, by providing households, small enterprises and institutions with access to affordable solar energy. Since late 2022, I\u2019m also the independent chairperson of a large Dutch philanthropic family foundation, which focusses on impact investments in Eastern Africa and on nature conservation in Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, I\u2019ve been the interim Chief Operations Officer of African Parks (www.africanparks.org), an Africa based non-profit conservation organisation which manages 22 parks covering more than 20 million hectares in 12 countries. At this moment I support (part-time) African Parks with the development and monetization of nature based solutions and I\u2019m the chair of two of the parks under management in Zambia.\n\nSince February 2019, I'm an independent non-executive director at OMNIA Holdings Limited, a JSE listed diversified chemicals Group, focused on agriculture and mining. I\u2019m a member of the board\u2019s Audit & Risk Committee and I chair the Social & Ethics Committee. \n\nFurthermore, I facilitate personal and team development trails in the African bush and in European wilderness areas for individuals and - corporate - groups and moderate leadership courses at Comenius Leergangen (www.comeniusleergang.nl).\n\nPrior to this I combined 35 years of industry and strategic management consulting experience. Since 2007 I have been active on the African continent and I\u2019m a true believer in the opportunities the continent has to offer in the decades to come. I\u2019m passionate about the ability of corporations and society to achieve this sustainably with a keen eye on community development and nature conservation.\n\nUntil December 2017, I have been heading Kearney's (www.kearney.com) expansion in Africa and fulfilled various other leadership roles within the firm at local, regional and global level.",
