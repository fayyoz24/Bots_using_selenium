    "summary": "I am Michela Spampinato, from Italy and I am a student at Maastricht University, enrolled in the European Law bachelor. The study program aims to prepare students in different fields of law, given that it offers several comparative law courses combined with European and International law. Maastricht University is famous for its Problem-Based Learning (PBL), the educational method which focuses on the learning process, making it possible to develop critical thinking and the ability to work independently under correct supervision. \n\nHere in Maastricht, I decided to put myself in the game right away. I joined ELSA Maastricht and became part of the Competition Committee for two years in a row, now.\u00a0\u00a0I believe moot court could be a good chance to put myself out there, get out of my comfort zone, and get finally involved in something I am really passionate about. Having this kind of experience helped enhance my legal\nknowledge, but it also helped me grow particular legal skills such as research, communication\nand presentation skills along with my studies and improving my soft skills, useful in any day of life.\n\nIn 2019, after graduating High School, I packed my bags and moved to New York City to be an au pair. I lived there for a year, working for a family, and taking care of their children, while living with them. During my AuPair year, I learned what it means teamwork, by working alongside a busy\nDistrict Attorney single mother for the care of her two kids; this helped me develop my skills in\ntime organizing, problem-solving and definitely increased my sense of commitment as well.\n\nAlong with my studies, to sustain my expenses and my life abroad, I am working Part-time as a barista. Although this side job might take part of my time away from my studies, it keeps myself focused on the primary goal. Studying and contemporarily working taught me that the key to success is commitment and consistency.",
