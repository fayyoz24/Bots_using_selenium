Throughout my employment at IHS, I was given many roles, from being a facilitator in the academic programmes to supporting different core period programmes and projects. I was tasked to prepare and develop materials in quantitative research skills required for students' assignments and evaluate them. I managed a variety of tasks including Tailor-made Training (TMT) and Refresher Courses (RC) which are NUFFIC courses funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and involved in projects such as H2020 Smart Control of The Climate Resilience in European Coastal Cities (SCORE).",
