    "summary": "I am a driven ICT/Finance professional with 24 years of experience in many aspects of ICT and Finance & Control.\n\nDuring my career I have worn many hats: I started as Assistant Auditor, moved to an Accounting/Controllers function and then switched to the ICT/ERP world. As ERP consultant I have experience in many aspects of the implementation of Financial, ERP and CRM applications such as Project Management, System Analysis and Design, Data Migration, Technical Installations and Upgrades, development of Forms and Management Reports and user training. \n\nThe last 12 years I have worked as independent consultant in both ICT and Finance & Control projects.\n\nMy added value lies in particular in this combination of my financial background and experience and affinity with automation. As I speak both the language of system users and the technical language of developers and have a good understanding of database structures and languages, I am especially strong when I can combine these areas. \n\nI am very driven to learn new things, to continue to evolve and to pursue the highest quality.\n\nCharacteristics: analytic, hands-on mentality, pragmatic and results-oriented, perseverance, creative, loyal and flexible attitude, clear and enthusiastic communications style (with a touch of humour).",
