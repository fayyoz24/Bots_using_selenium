    "summary": "I am a software engineer with almost two decades of industrial and academic background but coding is also a hobby for me since my childhood. My experience mainly lies within Java and JVM based languages (Kotlin, Scala, Groovy) but time to time I like to learn new languages too. Most of my professional work has been focused on developing novel and cutting edge distributed middleware from scientific computing, via strategic financial applications to my current area which is ultra low latency services sitting atop big data. I have strong experience with developing reusable, multi-threaded and high performance server side libraries and services but also with creating enterprise applications or even GUI components. I am comfortable with bit level performance tuning but also with high level architecture design.    \n \nDiscovery, evaluation and integration of new technologies have been always an important part of my work. Evangelization, trainings and presentations both professional and academic are regular to me. I am happy to work on untouched, new areas where self-sufficiency and setting directions is essential but also as part of an agile team where efficient team work is in the focus.\n\nSpecialties: Deep knowledge in Java (concurrency, Spring, Web-Services, OSGi, Jini, J2EE, open source libraries), Kotlin, Scala, Scripting (Shell, Python), large scale build infrastructure and release automation, cloud technologies, evangelisation and trainings, software architecture and team leadership.",
