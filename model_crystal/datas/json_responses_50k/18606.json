    "summary": "I am passionate about using online channels to not only connect with other people but also promote my stories. For me, it is crucial to know and follow the latest trends but it is valuable to make my work stand out from these trends. In my career, I want to note 3 key areas: \n\n1) Content: I have developed and managed different types of interactive content. They vary from social media posts to website, email content in the digital/event marketing and communication projects. \n\n2) Design: I have created different visual and video assets for the branding of dynamic marketing and communication campaigns during my internships. \n\n3) Analytics: I have gained numerous practical skills in using the Google tools and other CRM/analytics software to evaluate the performance of various online/on-site marketing and communication activities. \n\nWithin these areas, I focus on demonstrating hands-on practice, optimization, and a can-do attitude. In work and study, I am a result-driven person who highly adapts to unexpected situations while resolving difficulties by implementing effective strategies. Feel free to connect with me and I would love to share/learn about how to become a true marketer/communicator!",

I got 8.5/10 for this thesis. I hope that it will help explore the growth of Zoom fatigue in virtual togetherness, which challenges online interactions between people through their reliance on video conferencing platforms like Zoom for different virtual work and study activities.",

This business plan also underscored our vision of innovating our cooking lessons to enhance the positions of these cooking classes in the social entrepreneurial market.
