    "summary": "PhD in Physics and Optical Engineer, specialist in Optics, Laser Physics and Quantum Physics.\n\nI hold a double Master's degree in the fields of Engineering and Optical Sciences (obtained from the Institut d'Optique Graduate School) and in Fundamental and Applied Physics (obtained from the Paris-Saclay University).\n\nI moved from France to the Netherlands in 2012 to undertake a PhD in quantum physics in the group of Prof. Dr. Florian Schreck at the University of Amsterdam. There, I developed experimental methods to cool down atoms and molecules close to absolute zero and manipulate them at the quantum level. After my PhD, I remained an extra year as a postdoc in my PhD laboratory to guide new students towards next-generation experiments.\n\nI am now a postdoc at LaserLaB Amsterdam, where I work on the high-precision laser spectroscopy of the helium ion. My current research involves state-of-the-art frequency metrology, ultrafast lasers, frequency combs, optical parametric amplification (OPA) and soft X-ray production techniques.\n\nBeyond my scientific expertise, I regard teamwork and project management as the most critical aspects of my research. Success is conditioned not only to technical abilities but also to a strong team spirit and human connection. I strongly believe that a positive work culture is essential to achieving great scientific outcomes, and I emphasize this in all aspects of my work.",

In a small but dedicated team of researchers, I developed experimental methods to cool down atoms close to absolute zero and to manipulate them at the quantum level.\n\nMy research project involved building and operating complex laser and electro-optics systems, designing physics experiments and gathering/processing complex experimental data. Teamwork, team management and student supervision were also essential components of this scientific journey.",
