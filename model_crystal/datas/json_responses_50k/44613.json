I created models to predict the amount of machines needed for a given group of products and market demand in Intel test factories. These models decreased prediction time from 80 hours (using manual procedures) to 1 hour. I also designed models to simulate machine-shared capacities and optimize capital spending versus the probability of meeting weekly demand in Intel test factories, which resulted in reduced machine inventory, where the average machine cost was half a million dollars.",

In this role, I designed and led a team to implement an automatic validation process for the Data Feed Forward system that eliminated the errors that accounted for 37% of all the show stopping failures across all Intel factory tools in 2008.

In this role I also discovered, led a task force to root cause, and deployed a solution to resolve a database mis-association error that caused the stoppage of all cross-site shipping during the roll out of a new multi-site process.",
