    "summary": "Hi there! Welcome to my profile!\n\nI\u2019ve always been a great problem solver, challenge seeker, and technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I\u2019m working from home as an Android engineer, and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.\n\nI met coding when deciding which school to enroll in and then fell in love. In the beginning, I imagined it as a hobby but then I realized software engineering was the right field for me. I decided to enroll in Computer Engineering and Information Theory at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable companies. Today, I\u2019m working as an Android Engineer with a fantastic team, and I am getting into writing Medium blogs on my own time.\n\nI\u2019m familiar with various programming languages, including Kotlin, Java, Dart, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python, and AngularJS, but I\u2019m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I\u2019m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!\n\nSchedule a call with me: https://calendly.com/igorstevanovic99.",
