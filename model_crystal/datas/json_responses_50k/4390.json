The pre-production and research involved to make each of these shoots happen was extensive, but paid off in the end! \n\n\u2022 Cape Town, South Africa \u2013 4 different shoots in 10 days. We researched and contacted individuals to photograph who are making a difference in their community. Notably was Bonga.org Cycling Academy (Changing lives through sport and education). We landed a special feature in Athleta and Goodsport Magazine that helped bring attention to Bonga's inspirational youth program.  \n\n\u2022 Calvin Klein & Tommy Hilfiger \u2013 Fast-paced e-commerce environment. We worked closely with art and creative directors, maintaining a consistent feeling in the imagery of the brand across all platforms. We developed a smooth workflow and teamwork was essential in order to complete the target number of looks each day.\n\n\u2022 Levi\u2019s x Vogue \u2013 We worked closely with the creative director of Vogue to photograph an\nadvertorial campaign for Levi\u2019s to be used in Vogue and Vogue Man.",
