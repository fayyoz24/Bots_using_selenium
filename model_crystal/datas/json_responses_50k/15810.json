As a result, our team created concise guidelines by including a clear timeline for implementing changes.\n\nMy contribution included the following: \n\n- Researching the level of sustainability index per country in order to define their readiness for sustainable practices \n- Researching potential sustainable solutions for reducing Food Waste such as Artificial Intelligence\n- Got in touch with a company that offers AI as a product to reduce food waste & prepared a business proposal together that I presented to the Board of MasterChef\n- Created a roadmap for change&adoption for all different territories where MasterChef is produced based on the country's level of sustainability practices and a budget of the local broadcaster.",
