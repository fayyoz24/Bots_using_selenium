    "summary": "MediaMonks' house writer since 2008\u2014dreaming up aphorisms for fortune cookies and companies, and everything in between. As a conscientious copywriter, punctuation pundit and alliteration artist, I craft copy and concepts and currently captain our international team of writers.\n\nIn 2008, I was the first copywriter to join MediaMonks. Countering the financial crisis, MediaMonks became one of the most prolific creative companies worldwide, growing from 50 to 750 Monks in less than a decade.\n\nSince going public as SFOR, we've mushroomed to some 9,000 Monks across 30+ countries as we work to become the best production partner in any field and market. I've been fortunate to have been riding this wave since the start\u2014working in a creative team with Jouke Vuurmans and helping to build our brand alongside Wesley ter Haar and Victor Knaap.\n\nAs the youngest of the twenty oldest Monks, I've been able to gain invaluable experience while finishing three degrees along the way. I hold a degree in Communication & Multimedia Design and a second bachelor's in Media & Culture through an accelerated curriculum. I completed my studies with an MA in New Media & Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam\u2014the international top-ranking programme within the field of media studies.\n\nI\u2019ve been fully dedicated to spreading the MediaMonks gospel ever since and became our head copywriter in 2018. Next to a thousand projects, I also accidentally created our original tagline: Crafted with Care, Coded by Coffee, Celebrated with Champagne.\n\nTL;DR\n2021: Copy Director, Media.Monks\n2018: Lead Copywriter, MediaMonks\n2014: Sr. Copywriter, MediaMonks\n2013: MA, New Media & Digital Culture\n2012: BA, Media & Culture\n2010: BCMM, Interactive Media\n2009: Minor, Creative Writing\n2008: Copywriter, MediaMonks",
