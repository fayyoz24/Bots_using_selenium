    "summary": "Hi there,\n\nExperienced data science consultant at day, student at night. My greatest asset is curiosity, which is the driving force behind everything I do and it defines my career. \n\n- 'Why do people behave the way they do?' inspired me to study Psychology. \n- 'How can I prove my findings?' inspired me to get a Masters degree in Statistics. \n- 'How can I drive change with data?' is why I became a consultant. \n- 'How does it work?' is why I love open source and math.\n\nAlthough I specialize in data science I am also interested and have experience in related fields like data engineering. The combination of my broad interest and consulting experience allows me to easily collaborate with all relevant stakeholders in an end-to-end data science project.\n\nMore information on www.ernst-bolle.com.",
