The goal of the project is on the one hand to explore innovative applications of data science. In addition, we aim to better understand how we need to structure the innovation process in such a way that these innovative applications actually end up in production. \n\nSome of the other projects I worked on:\n\nSmart Diabetes care with Reinforcement Learning\nIn the Lectoraat I explore the use of Reinforcement Learning in assisting diabetic type 1 patients in how much insuline they should take.

This part of my PhD is focused on using data-assimilation to get an optimal estimate of the spatial distribution of radiation levels following an accident. I do this using both an atmospheric transport model and observations of radiation levels, combining them using data assimilation.\n\nIn addition to research I was also involved in teaching courses at both bachelor and master level. These involved teaching multivariate statistics, introductory statistics, geostatistics and python programming. I also attend courses myself in Scientific Writing and Philosophy of Science.\n\nkeywords:\nstatistics, geostatistics, data assimilation, particle filter",
