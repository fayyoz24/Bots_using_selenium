    "summary": "My name is Guilherme de Almeida, I'm 37 years old, born in Brazil, raised in Amsterdam and in the United States, and currently living in the region of Amsterdam. A world citizen by heart!\n\nI've a bachelor degree in marketing and a pre-master in accounting & control, both economic studies. I've years of experience as a marketing freelancer. I see myself as a highly motivated \"marketing\" and \"sales professional\" with a track record of helping to create small businesses, and letting them grow into a more efficient business phase.\n\nAlthough I have a background in marketing and sale, I also have an affinity with international trade, finance and the diamond trade. Over the past few years I also have developed a deep passion for finance/investments and also a deep desire to learn more about the diamond industry. At the beginning of this year I even decided to put the theory into practice and started building my own personal portfolio using \"DeGiro\" platform.   \n\nMy investment philosophy is based on value investing. In other words, no speculation, but building a diversified portfolio with a long-term view. Much of my inspiration comes from the best mutual funds in the world where \"index investing\", \"diversification\", \"discipline\" and \"low cost\" have long been established. For me, there was is reason why small investors should not be able to enjoy financial benefits just like the professionals in the field.  \n\nRight now I am looking for an exciting and challenging job in an international and multilingual environment that is run on a healthy dose of ambition. A place with a diverse, collaborative and inclusive culture where people from all walks of life feel a sense of belonging.",
