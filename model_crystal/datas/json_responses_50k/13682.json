    "summary": "My name is Dillowan Briefkani, and live in Utrecht in the Netherlands.\n\nCurrently I am working as Area Lead | Manager Store & Connect (DataWareHouse & Integration Platforms) at Worldline.\n\nIn the past I worked for different consulting firms for which I have been deployed as a Project and Program Manager in (international) projects on the intersection of Business and IT, within several branches in the financial and telecom sector.\n\nMy background lies in (international) project environments where I started up, implemented, migrated, deployed, advised and managed projects. My experience in cashmanagement, SEPA, Securities, Code Review, Mortgages, Order Management, Portfoliomanagement and process changes give me a good starting basis. \n\nI am an outgoing person who feels perfectly at home in complex, dynamic and politically sensitive environments. Furthermore, I am focussed on results, achieving deadlines, and I always keep the market and commercial focus in mind.\n\nBy my environment I am characterized as: driven, independent, entrepreneurial, analytical, take initiative, proactive, communicative, social skills, flexible, curious, fast learner and result-orientated.\n\nI have also been closely involved in competence development and the training of Project Management and PMO professionals. In addition, I have been a coach for several project professionals and was a mentor for new employees.\n\nNext to my work I love to travel (especially through Asia), drive my motorcycle and to relax I practice several sports.",

PROX6 takes responsibility for the assignment and will always act in the interest of the customer. We take care for the projects of our customers, like a good parent provides for the development of their children. \n\nWe distinguish ourselves by taking responsibility for the execution of a project that goes beyond the assignment, we create peace for our clients by giving insight into the decision-making, by showing model behavior that is focussed on cooperation and especially to be pro-active and coming up with new initiatives. Therefore our people are often deployed in partnerships with subcontractors (for example outsourcing)  to represent the interests of our clients and to complete projects succesffully, while keeping the customer requirements in focus.",
