    "summary": "\u2022 Graduation: materials engineering and master's degree in mechanical engineering with emphasis in materials and processes at FEI University Center. MBA in Project Management at FGV. \n\n\u2022 High skill in Process Engineering, being responsible for 3 different production processes. On that occasion, Six Sigma Black Belt projects were developed focused on quality improvement that presented a financial return of R$ 533.7k in 2 years. Continuous research for process cost reduction leaded to a decrease of R$ 258.8k in 1 year.\n\n\u2022 5 years of experience in Product Development Engineering throughout its entire life cycle (from technical feasibility to ram up) using project management, PPAP, APQP and FMEA methodology. Quality improvements focused on regular products promoting scrap and rework costs reduction, on 2018 to 2019 of 60% and 2019 to 2020 of 71%.\n\n\u2022 As a result driven person, I am also passionate about team working, after all there is no better way to promote continuous professional and personal improvement!\n\n\u300bEuropean citizenship is a differential.",
