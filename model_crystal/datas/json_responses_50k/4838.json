    "summary": "Dr Hanna Boogaard has more than 15 years of experience in air pollution epidemiology. She is a Consultant Principal Scientist at the Health Effects Institute (HEI) in Boston, MA, an independent research organization with balanced funding from the US Environmental Protection Agency and motor vehicle industry. She received a PhD in 2012 in air pollution epidemiology from Utrecht University, Netherlands. She studied health effects of traffic-related air pollution, and the effectiveness of traffic policy measures. At HEI, she is involved in research oversight and review of studies investigating the health effects of air pollution and studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve air quality and public health. In addition, she is involved in developing and overseeing new research programs on non-tailpipe traffic emissions, studies assessing adverse health effects of long-term exposure to low levels of ambient air pollution, and studies on health effects of traffic-related air pollution. Furthermore, she is leading an expert HEI panel to systematically evaluate the evidence for the associations of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution with adverse human health outcomes. She holds a MSc in Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences (2005) from Maastricht University, Netherlands.She has been advisor of National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, World Health Organization, Health Canada, and other national and international bodies. She is Associate Editor of Public Health, Environmental Epidemiology & Health Impact Assessment for the journal Environment International. She is on the Editorial Review Board for Environmental Health Perspectives, and is a frequent reviewer for many other environmental health journals. She is co-chair of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) Europe Chapter and member of the Scientific Organizing Committee of multiple ISEE conferences.",

In addition, she is co-leading HEI\u2019s Program assessing the health effects of traffic-related air pollution, noise and their interactions with socio-economic status. Furthermore, she leads several reviews of studies investigating exposure and health effect of air pollution, and is currently conducting a Cochrane Systematic review of interventions to reduce ambient particulate matter air pollution and their effect on health. \n\nHEI is a nonprofit corporation chartered in 1980 as an independent research organization to provide high-quality, impartial, and relevant science on the health effects of air pollution.
