With the establishment of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015, technology is increasingly seen as a solution to managing flood risks. This research aims to review best practices of how different stakeholders have used technology to manage flood risks. The stakeholders identified are the public sector (government agencies), the private sector (established firms and start-ups) and the social sector (NGOs and civil society). A complex systematic review of various best-practice case studies will be conducted. \nExpert opinions from our stakeholder groups will inform this review process through semi-structured interviews. These results will then be fitted onto a case-study matrix based on the stakeholders and the five stages of the disaster risk management cycle. This final product of this research will include a detailed report of the methods, analyses and results, as well as an interactive executive summary of the key conclusions that can be distributed to interested potential stakeholders. The final conclusions of this investigation will be presented at the Maastricht Undergraduate Research Conference in June 2022 and the Flood Knowledge Summit 2022 in UNU-MERIT, Maastricht, in July 2022.\n\nSupervisor: Dr Serdar Turkeli, Research Lead (UNU-MERIT)",
