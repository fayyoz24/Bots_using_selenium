I\u2019m responsible for translating customer requirements into component and process requirements. In close cooperation with our panel design departments in China and Taiwan and suppliers these components are developed. \nThe customers in the Automotive market expect more robust products in order to limit their field returns. Since the display module is sensitive to impact and environmental effects, Innolux is expected to set the standard for robust optical module design. The optical aspects need to be pro-actively aligned with the mechanical, electrical, touch and coverlens functionality in the display module. At the same time the design also needs to be optimized from the perspective of yield and manufacturability. \nSome of the job key responsibilities are:\n-\tDesigning and choosing the backlight illumination parts  (e.g. LED type, optical foils, lightguide, etc.)\n-\tDiscussing optical performance and issues with customers (e.g. BMW and Audi) on weekly basis.\n-\tExecuting  failure analysis on display modules after production or reliability testing (e.g. pixel moir\u00e9, mura, pixel defects, discoloration effects, light leakage etc)\n-\tReleasing and testing of new optical measurement equipment.\n-\tExecution and evaluation of thermal measurements on display modules using thermocouples and IR camera.\n-\tDevelopment of optical calibration algorithms in C# ( i.e. calibration of WP, gamma and luminance to the specified targets)\n-\tPlanning, executing, evaluating and discussing optical measurements (colourpoints over angles and temperature, flicker, image sticking, uniformity, gamma, contrast, reflection and switching times)\n-\tStatistical analysing of in-line optical sample build data.",

To contribute to this goal I studied and reported the physical behavior of vibrating structures under acoustic loads. To achieve this I invented numerous experiments and used an finite elements simulation program (Comsol Multiphysics) to back up my findings.",
