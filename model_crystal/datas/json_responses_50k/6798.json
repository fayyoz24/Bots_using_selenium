    "summary": "About me: after 20 years of living abroad, I relocated to the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years I have worked as a yoga teacher and yoga therapist specialised in the therapeutic elements of yoga in the USA, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Before, I worked in pharmaceuticals & medical devices both in the Netherlands and Switzerland. I have 10+ years sales experience. I have a bachelor degree in nutrition and dietetics. After moving back to the Netherlands, I shortly worked for an e-commerce fashion platform and participated in a project about how we can provide an \u201cout of the box\u201d daycare for the elderly in the future. I got involved in this matter because I was the chairman of the Client Council of Kloek Amsterdam, an institution for elderly suffering from dementia from January 2020 until January 2022. \n\nAs a mom I've led my daughter through an international school carrier (IB) and volunteered as a member of several school Parents Associations in 3 different countries. I\u2019m fluent in Dutch, English and German. \n",
