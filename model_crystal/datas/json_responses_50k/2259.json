    "summary": "(Neuro)Marketing Project Specialist, sometimes cosplayer, but always devoted to fuse my tri-forced background in Economics, Corporate Advertising and Applied Cognitive Psychology to get the job done.\n\nAddicted to webcomics, gaming, animation and eurobeat music, my passion for the Entertainment Industry is never ending just as my manga collection.\n\n\ud83e\uddb8\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f The strongest potential for the Entertainment Industry comes by us. That's through the heroes we admire, love, and identify with, everyday. And that's why I worked on \"Character Management\", designing it to induce several benefit in fictional characters' goods sales whenever entertainment consumers get interested or identify with them (~87.5%).\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Indeed, Character Management can potentially bring much higher efficiency and effectiveness on revenue, if combined with Entertainment Marketing & Management strategies. Character Management for the Entertainment Industry has also been awarded with an Academic Honor Mention by Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Palermo, after its special committee. Available at: doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20198.70720.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Poke me in chat if you wanna know more about it. I swear I won't bore you with 115 pages of psychosocial trips \ud83d\ude07.",

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29910.83527\n\n\u2022 Conducted Eye-Tracking experiments for 46 subjects, measuring their Microsaccades after multiple simple or complex visual stimuli were memorized, to see if they both biased Visual Attention at the same time (spoiler: they did).\n\n\u2022 Analyzed 410,000+ data points (microsaccades) with MATLAB (programming), ran statistical analyses for significance testing with Jamovi (T-Test; Repeated Measures ANOVA).\n\n\u2022 Extracted 280 visual stimuli with a self-built Python script (with OpenCV and NumPy).\n\n\u2022 Recruited more than 60 subjects, with a peak average of 7 subjects sign-ups per day. Cooked Pasta alla Carbonara reward for the two best performers I had in my experiments.\n\n\u2022 Received a very positive feedback on my design for data visualization with graphs, both for significant and general data results.
