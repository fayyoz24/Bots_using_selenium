Since 2020, I've been a member of the 'Constitutionalizing in the Anthropocene' Sector Plan research project, conducting research on topics related to law and climate change, the Anthropocene, systems and complexity theory.\n\nPrior to my academic career, I was a legal consultant with substantial experience and interest in consulting in difficult places in areas of law that are poorly covered or researched anywhere. Most recently I've done this on projects involving administrative and business law in Afghanistan, where I have worked for a total of 3.5 years on and off since 2008.",
