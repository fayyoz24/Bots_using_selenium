This approach aims to get a better view on the distributed nature of the brain's language comprehension network. In parallel, I developed techniques for simultaneously recording, and joint analysis, of EEG and fMRI data. I acquired and supervised a PhD project (Rene Scheeringa) to apply those techniques in working memory and visual perception research. \nOther duties involved supervising research master students in their projects, and teaching (in the Donders Toolkit courses)",
