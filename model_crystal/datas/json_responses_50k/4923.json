While I was attributed this role, I was in charge of scheduling posts, designing marketing strategies for the charity and organizing the Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media platforms available, alongside the social media team, tailored to the needs of the foundation. \n\nHandling a charity\u2019s social media proved to be challenging because a diplomatic image had to be respected and upheld, whilst sending a strong and creative message to various audiences, whether it be the general public or investors, towards a great cause. This has trained me to adapt to different types of audiences and develop my communication skills on multiple platforms, as well as develop my understanding of social media algorithms. Given I was volunteering at the FPA2 and completing my Master\u2019s in the Netherlands simultaneously, I had the chance of developing my time management skills, organization skills and cooperation skills all while working with colleagues in a different time zone so as to be as efficient as possible and adapt myself to different work environments. \n\nOn top of these skills, I was able to learn more and more every day about very important topics, such as the carbon footprint, the protection of oceans, global warming and the protection of animal species, amongst many others, all defended by the Principality of Monaco. Overall, it was both a chance and a pleasure to volunteer for and learn from Dr Diane Vachon, Consulate of Monaco in Canada, and be a part of the FPA2 (Canada)\u2019s agenda.",

After being thoroughly instructed, I was tasked with preparing some country profiles in order to brief other diplomats and high-ranking officials on certain countries before meetings or events. \n\nAs a student this helped me apply theory to real-life cases: it is important to study the history and culture of a country as preparation before meeting officials to understand the motivations, priorities and goals of the nation in front of us, from a political, social and economic perspective. More than that, this internship was an excellent opportunity to learn from individuals with life-long experience in the field of international relations and diplomacy.",

The program took place on Victoria Island, on the CFB Esquimalt, and offered recruits the opportunity of learning more about the Royal Canadian Navy\u2019s innerworkings given the base\u2019s access to the ocean. \n\nThis training developed in me a military state of mind, and helped me develop the mental and physical endurance needed in such a demanding and challenging program. During those 6 weeks, I was able to integrate values of duty, loyalty, integrity and courage to my work ethic, as well as to my own personal lifestyle, by learning from higher-ranked officials and being part of a chain of command. More importantly this experience has taught me that nothing is possible alone, and that teamwork and cooperation are key elements to successful operations, whether political or military. In this process, I learned that it is essential if not vital to be able to listen to others when needed as well as lead others when needed. On top of these skills, the program provided us activities ranging from developing military knowledge, obstacle courses, physical training, handling of weapons, topography, survival in the forest to the use of gas masks, and much more. More than that, the BMQ has instated in my comrades and I a sense of urgency, which has helped us both manage time more efficiently, and deal with high-risk situations more successfully, professionally and personally. \n\nFive years later, in 2023, I can say with great confidence that the biggest takeaways from this experience are the discipline, perseverance and resistance I have developed. In the final ceremony of the program, I was awarded the Commandant\u2019s Trophy, presented to the overall best recruit, something I still take great pride in, and which always reminds me that anything is possible with drive and intention.",
