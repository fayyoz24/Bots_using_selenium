    "summary": "Arnoud Keizer is a water management specialist and has a master degree in water management. He has expertise on integrated water resource management topics, such as drinking water supply, floods and drought assessments, hydrology, river restoration and climate smart interventions related to agricultural production. Advising on and implementation of small-scale water buffer solutions is one of his main fields of expertise. He uses his mapping skills to communicate project results on watershed level.\n\nHe has working experience in South American, African and Asian countries, with most recent experiences in Brazil, Tanzania and Bangladesh. For Aidenvironment he performs water balance assessments, including climate change and socio-economic scenarios, advising clients (NGO\u2019s, companies and governments) on environmentally sustainable and responsible use of water resources. Majority of these assessment are done in the context (preparation, guidance, review) of Environmental Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), because many programs impact local water resources. \nArnoud is experienced in setting up and facilitating training programs to capacitate organisations in integrated water resource management (IWRM), water security, Disaster Risk Reduction planning and GIS mapping. He sees thinking along watershed boundaries and development and support of local water governance structures as one of the important solutions to the world-wide water challenges of the 21st century. \nPreviously he worked for seven years for Royal HaskoningDHV as a project manager/engineer specializing in hydrological model simulations and river basin management option design, implementation and water resources monitoring. In his previous job, he completed several assignments for local water authorities. \n",
