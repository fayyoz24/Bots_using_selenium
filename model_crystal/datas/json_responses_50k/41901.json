After an arduous exploration, the track selected was Danish singer-songwriter Alex Vargas\u2019 hit, \u201cHigher Love,\u201d which was remixed to snugly fit the contours and rhythms of this iconic film.\n\nSome campaigns are ore difficult than others when it comes to getting the right music. But on this campaign we could work on a strategic level with Anomaly to get an artist that endorses the message of the brand. Alex Vargas and Diesel are advocating equal rights and celebrating love. As a strategic music agency we are always aiming for music to be a part of the campaign strategy. A big shout out to Alex Vargas, Locomotion and Brewhouse.\n\nAgency:\nAnomaly Amsterdam\nClient:\nDiesel\nGlobal CMO:\nRiccardo Bellini\nDirector:\nDavid LaChapelle\nPhotographer:\nDavid LaChapelle\nProduction Company:\nCXA/Maaven\nPost Production:\nMPC\nMusic Supervision:\nAmp Amsterdam\nMusic:\n'Higher Love' Alex Vargas\nRemix:\nBrewhouse Amplified\nAudio Post:\nAmp Amsterdam",
