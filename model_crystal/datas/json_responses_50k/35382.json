    "summary": "Epidemiologist & Public Health Professional | Policy Advisor | Nutrition Specialist\n\nProfile:\n\nMy name is Tacilja Nancy R\u00fcckert-Broerse (nickname: Tacilja), and I am a highly accomplished epidemiologist with a passion for improving policy & organizations and infectious diseases & public health. Besides, I have a deep understanding of nutrition and lifestyle (after 6 years of board membership with the Dutch Association of Dietitians (NVD) and 8 years of running my own dietician practice), which I combine with my two expertises in epidemiology to promote overall well-being in individuals and organizations alike. By approaching every task with warmth and professionalism, I strive to create a positive impact.\n\nI graduated as an epidemiologist from the prestigious Royal Institute for the Tropics in 2014. Throughout my studies, I focused on utilizing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and X2 statistics to translate complex data into visual models to understand the disease's prevalence and identify areas for intervention. My research involved an in-depth analysis of the spatial distribution of Tuberculosis in India, covering national, state, and district levels during the period of 2001-2011.\n\nMy academic achievements were recognized when I won a tender with the World Health Organization (WHO) for my thesis work, which involved mapping all countries of the world using advanced methods and techniques, and which therefore had a substantial value for the policy and the organization.\nI have collaborated with PhD epidemiologists from various countries, resulting in publications that can be found at the following links:\n\nGlobal Task Force on TB Impact Measurement: Predictive Ecological Model Kit - https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/hq-tuberculosis/global-task-force-on-tb-impact-measurement/meetings/2015-03/background_08_predictive_ecological_model_kit.pdf?sfvrsn=24263076_3\n\nDevelopment and Validation of a Predictive Ecological Model for TB Prevalence - https://www.kit.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/development-and-validation-of-a-predictive-ecological-model-for-TB-prevalence.pdf\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWith a deep-rooted passion for epidemiology and an unwavering commitment to making a positive impact on hospital and public health, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. I am confident that my academic knowledge, practical experience, and personal resilience will enable me to excel in any endeavor I undertake.\n\nMy mission: Let's create a healthier and more vibrant world!\n\nRead my extensive profile in 'Featured documents'.",
