    "summary": "Life starts outside of our comfort zone. This is a moto, that has guided me throughout my personal and professional life ever since I can remember myself.\n\nI am a Communications Strategist with international background and more than 6 years of working experience in the field of corporate and brand communication for external and internal audiences. \n\nI have worked as an intern at the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens and abroad, then returned to Athens for a position in the most impactful PR agency of the country and until July 2021 I was in the position of Senior Consultant in the Brand & Communications department @Deloitte Greece. \n\nSince September 2021 I am based in Amsterdam doing my Masters on Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam (number 1 Communication Science faculty globally) and simultaneously worked at the UvA Business School. Currently I'm part of the Global Communications team of @Booking.com on a mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. On the side I'm also trying to initiate a social deconstruction through my podcast, The Pink Dot /\n\nI enjoy great challenges, traveling around the world and working with people, who are inspired by making an impact.",
