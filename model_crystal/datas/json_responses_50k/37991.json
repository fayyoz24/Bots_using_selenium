    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn profile! I'm an experienced agricultural researcher, dedicated to driving positive change through sustainable agricultural practices, partnerships for impact at scale, and strategic resource mobilization.\n\nWith a diverse background spanning over a decade, I've managed complex projects and collaborated with stakeholders across the globe. My journey began as a Legume Agronomist and Systems Agronomist at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), where I developed my skills in multi-stakeholder engagement, project management, and innovative agricultural techniques.\n\nMy work as a Country Manager and Project Manager at the International Potato Center (CIP) in Malawi allowed me to oversee a portfolio of projects, collaborating with donors such as USAID, Irish Aid, EU and GIZ. I've successfully crafted and managed large-scale project proposals that secured significant funding and facilitated meaningful collaborations.\n\nAs a PhD candidate at Wageningen University, I focused on participatory approaches to diversification and intensification of crop production on smallholder farms in Malawi, with focus on maize, soybean, groundnuts and sweetpotato. This academic journey enriched my understanding of sustainable agricultural practices and the importance of research-driven solutions.\n\nMy proficiency in resource mobilization has led me to register as an independent consulting business in the Netherlands. I've worked on many proposals for prestigious donors to create compelling proposals that drive impactful projects forward. I am also interested in taking on other technical or scientific assignments in the international agri-food sector.\n\nOver the years, I've effectively collaborated with CGIAR Centers, government entities, NGOs, and private sector partners. My role as a liaison between stakeholders has allowed me to foster meaningful partnerships that accelerate positive change within the agricultural sector.\n\nI'm here to connect with fellow professionals, collaborators, and organizations who are passionate about sustainable agriculture, international development, and impactful research. Let's explore opportunities to create lasting change together.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you're interested in discussing innovative agricultural practices, project management, research collaboration, or anything related to international business development.",
