    "summary": "I am a master\u2019s student in Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands with a strong passion for genomic immunology. I am currently conducting my second master\u2019s research internship at the Pelka lab in San Francisco as part of The Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology. My research aims to better understand the cellular interactions that shape anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies against cancer and other immune-related diseases. Please feel free to reach out if you share this passion for genomic immunology or would like to learn more about me and my interests.\n\nPelka lab: https://pelkalab.org",
