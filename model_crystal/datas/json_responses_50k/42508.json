I developed integrated components for the desktop and mobile versions.\n\nADVERTISING MANAGER\nI was given an open brief to develop an advertising manager function. The interface appears in the user's feed and facilitates tailoring an advertising campaign to meet their individual needs. Other functions included the ability to monitor statistical feedback. Produced in collaboration with a UX designer and backend developer the final product was well received.\n\nONLINE SHOPPING MALL\nAnother major project was my development of an interface for an integrated ecommerce platform. This provides a catalogue of goods, filtered searches, a shopping cart, and an interface for processing orders with delivery and payment requirements.\n\nPROMOTION & GAME PROJECTS\nI produced small applications to enable the purchase of OK.RU's online virtual gifts. Further, I enjoyed making animated promotions for some major external companies. Using the React framework I completed several games to engage the interest of users.\n\nIt has been a great and very varied experience working for a company with such a major online presence. My projects have run from the very first photographic module, through introducing email-markup, also conducting code review, and configuring A/B testing and much more. I believe I have demonstrated my adaptability by supporting a variety of other teams.",
