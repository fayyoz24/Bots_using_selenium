    "summary": "Black Star Foundation is a non-profit organization which has been committed to promote reggae music in Holland for 20 years. The foundation organizes reggae events and concerts, manages and handles bookings for artists/bands, publishes music on its own label and supports and develops new talent.\n\nBACKGROUND OF BLACK STAR FOUNDATION:\nBlack Star Foundation is started up because of idealistic ideas of the founder Michelle Boekhout van Solinge. She graduated in Geography (University of Amsterdam, 1997), travelled a lot in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean and in the year 2002 she lived and worked in Ghana (West Africa). There she got the idea to stimulate the communication between Western and non-Western countries and to bring people with different cultural backgrounds a little closer to each other.\n\nThrough art and culture (especially music) the foundation wants to contribute in the cultural integration, in bringing people together with different cultural backgrounds and work together on one project. Music is perfect for that, it is a shared interest from people all over the world, a language we all speak, no matter where you are from. Based on that, Black Star Foundation has developed her activities.\n\nTHE GOAL OF BLACK STAR FOUNDATION:\nThe goal of Black Star Foundation is to promote and stimulate artists from abroad and, more in general, to promote the exchange of western and non-western art, music and culture.\n\nThe foundation tries to achieve their goal by:\n    * Organizing multicultural concerts and other events whereby the artists themselves will exchange experiences, skills and understanding;\n    * Obtaining financial means and credit facilities for promoting artists from countries outside of Europe;\n    * Cooperating with other organizations with corresponding goals.\n\nMORE INFO:\nWebsite: www.blackstarfoundation.nl\nFacebook:  www.facebook.com/BlackStarFoundationAmsterdam\nWebstore: bit.ly/blackstarstore",

Over the years several Dutch organizations and artists have been traveling with her to this beautiful island for a musical tour. E.g. Brainpower came to Jamaica to record a video clip with the legendary Yellowman, Michelle accompanied a film crew in Kingston for a Dutch TV program with host Chris Zegers and singer/songwriter Tim Knol and recently Michelle went to Jamaica with the Netherlands Wind Ensemble for rehearsals, two performances (Montego Bay and Kingston) with different Jamaican artists, a masterclass at Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts (Kingston) and videoshoots for the upcoming theatretour in Holland (May 2023). \n\nDo you also want to go to Jamaica for e.g. recording an album, video clip(s) or a collaboration with Jamaican reggae artists, bands or sound engineers, and you do not have the right contacts for it? Please send an e-mail to michelle@blackstarfoundation.nl or contact Michelle by phone (+31 64 60 414 20).\nMore info: https://www.blackstarfoundation.nl/en/project/musical-tour-in-jamaica-(2005-till-now)/74",

He had maintained the Irie Dutch/Belgian Reggae/Ska Concert agenda for so many years and his website was well known in the reggae scene of Belgium and the Netherlands, but also beyond.\n\nThe new Irielion.com website is initiated in 2014 by a few Dutch reggae fanatics, who really missed the old Irielion reggae agenda. Out of respect for Maddoc we continued his work for the Dutch and Belgian reggae scene for more than 5 years.",

Out of respect for Maddoc we are continuing his work for the Dutch and Belgian reggae scene. "
