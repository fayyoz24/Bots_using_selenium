    "summary": "Our society is facing rapid changes and developments in society and in the digital sphere.\n\nAI tools for instance have already shown their share in political scandals across the world. Populist demagogues use social media to disseminate exclusionary and extremist narratives. The ease and speed of spreading information online have facilitated the spread of misinformation and harmful conspiracy theories. Furthermore, scholars are fearful that social media may induce online echo chambers: only exposing individuals to their pre-existing beliefs, values and perspectives, while shielding them from opposing or diverse viewpoints.\n\nSuch challenges require novel approaches towards research.\n\nAs a Social Sciences for a Digital Society graduate, I have developed such an approach. An approach that transcends disciplinary and methodological boundaries. An approach that believes that effective communication and valorisation is just as important as rigorous data analysis. An approach committed to understanding and addressing the most pressing issues facing society today.\n\nMy skillset in this approach is extensive. I am skilled in both quantitative research and qualitative methods, and seek to find approaches to science that transcend the traditional ideas of what \u201cresearch\u201d means. For instance, I have strong analytical skills and programming experience in R and Python, enabling me to perform many types of quantitative and computational analyses on large datasets. At the same time, I also have experience with interviewing and filmmaking, enabling me to create visual representations that can reach much wider audiences than academic papers can.\n\nI believe it is exactly the intersection of these different approaches, across methodological and disciplinary borders, that is able to address the most pressing issues of this age.\n\nCurrently, I am part of a cross-national research project analyzing the economic and cultural roots of populism; a collaboration of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, La Sapienza University of Rome, University of Birmingham, Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster, and Exeter University (precede.eu).\n\nWhen I am not working, I spend my time traveling, writing, photographing, filming and experiencing the world.",
