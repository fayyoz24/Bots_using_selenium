    "summary": "My life choices are based upon the following three drives:\n- Non-western cultures and world views\n- Human attitudes and behaviour\n- Contributing to personal growth\n\nTherefore I obtained two master\u2019s degrees Cum Laude: a MA in Geography and Education and a MSc in Social Psychology. My work experience and expertise was built (during my studies) in a broad area; as a researcher sustainability education at the university, as a geography teacher to pupils of all ages and educational levels, as a tour manager and guide on nature and hiking holidays, as an intern for public communication at a provincial government and as a coach and trainer for teachers-to-be in intensive exam courses. I have complemented this experience with as much travelling through non-western regions as possible, in which I developed a special love for the Spanish-speaking world and the Balkans.\n\nEmployers and supervisors consistently describe me as \u2018enthusiastic\u2019, \u2018eager to learn\u2019 and \u2018strongly self-motivated\u2019 and characterize my work as \u2018thorough\u2019 and \u2018analytical\u2019. Colleagues and pupils describe me often as \u2018inspiring\u2019, 'open minded' and \u2018a joy to work with\u2019. If you believe that we may be a good professional match or if you feel like sharing a coffee for some mutual inspiration, feel free to send me a message.",

In my work, I strive to integrate geography and social psychology, within the field of Education.\n\nNow I am a PhD candidate in Geography & Education at the faculty of Geosciences. Since climate change has its inevitable footprints on youngsters' futures, 'climate change education' in secondary schools is urgently needed. But how to concretise this into teaching practices? In my research, I focus on teachers' positionality and their agency in an arena of ideas on how to teach (improve) climate change education. This arena includes international (EU) statements, the educational contexts (and geography curricula) of distinct European countries, and individual teachers' motives (identities) and actual teaching practices. I am particularly interested in the contexts of Spain, the Balkans and the Netherlands,\n\nAs a researcher, I truly believe that we cannot fully \"see\" and understand 'other' contexts and people from our own place (e.g. a desk in the VMA). Thus, I also use on-site fieldwork and auto-ethnography to keep growing in cultural sensitivity within my research, and cultural self-awareness of my own (professional) position.",
