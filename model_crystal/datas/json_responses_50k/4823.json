Hathaway's research consists of promoting a variety of organizations of wool, shepherdry, transhumance (the walking of animals to pasture), migrant associations and rural revitalization. Please see research blog here: woolallianceforsocialagency.blog and @woolmarch on Instagram\n\nWASA is also working with International partners in various nodes of the wool waste stream, particularly in post consumer garment wool waste. Presently, she is co-founder of Wool Mountain Pakistan, and partnered with Hasnain Lilani of Recycle Wool, the largest importer of post consumer sweater waste located in Karachi, and social entrepreneur Gwendolyn Floyd. Together, the first of its kind research lab dedicated to recycling raw and wool waste is being established.\n\nThe research is funded with generous support from Creative Industries Fund NL\nWool March is generously supported by DOEN Foundation, Erfgoed Tilburg, Gemeente Tilburg",

The theme 'Artistic Connective Practices' was developed through a series of community workshops, discussions, lectures, and events with teachers, students and externals, to create a relevant research theme supporting current and future teaching and artistic practice, and a vital head research theme. The research took over a public foyer of the FHK, became a place for artistic researchers to meet each other, and external experts outside of the arts. A community garden was developed with student as an outdoor classroom to practice and test connective practices. Events such as the Potatofest, was a harvesting of the garden and ideas for the future identity of the FHK. \n\n\nTogether with Studio Renate Boere, the magazine DISCO* \u2013 Creating Artistic Connective Practices Through Artistic Research\u00a0has been developed in order to express the important steps which led to introducing the notion of connectivity as a way of doing artistic research.  *DISCO magazine provides an overview of the different actions Hathaway has implanted during her research and what has (sometimes literally) grown out from it. Highlighting the importance of connectivity and responsibility, the magazine expresses the openness of Hathaway\u2019s research to others, and establishes the importance of participation within artistic research today. Her practice-based research informed the theme and framework for the lectorship-to-be \u2018Artistic Connective Practices\u2019 (forthcoming 2020) at FHK, Tilburg.\n\nContributions: Elise Wortel\nCopy Editors: Sophie Krier and Renate Boere\nBook Concept and Design: Studio Renate Boere\n\nTo order a copy: http://shop.renateboere.nl/product/disco-creating-artistic-connective-practices-through-artistic-research/",
