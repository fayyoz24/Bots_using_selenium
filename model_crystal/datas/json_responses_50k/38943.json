In this context, due to their importance and ubiquity in natural language, analogy queries are of particular interest. Current developments in natural language processing and machine learning resulted in some very promising algorithms relying on deep learning neural word embeddings which might contribute to finally realizing analogy queries. However, it is still quite unclear how well these algorithms work from a semantic point of view. One of the problems is that there is no clear consensus on the intended semantics of analogy queries. Furthermore, there are no suitable benchmark dataset available respecting the semantic properties of real-life analogies. Therefore, in this, paper, we discuss the challenges of benchmarking the semantics of analogy query algorithms with a special focus on neural embeddings. We also introduce the AGS analogy benchmark dataset which rectifies many weaknesses of established datasets. Finally, our experiments evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms underline the need for further research in this promising field.",

These would help in finding weakened areas that are not paved or compacted at an optimum temperature. These weakened areas are visualized as a red bubble on the map. By clicking on the particular red bubble, it displays the temperature profile of an asphalt at each construction phase. \nSecond, we created a speed profile of the different machines (Paver and Rollers). From speed profile, we found a correlation between machines\u2019 speed and quality of the runway. We found that sometimes Paver and Rollers are not working at defined optimum speed, which could be a reason for the reduced quality of the runway.\nIn the last, we observed an evident correlation between environmental factors and temperature of asphalt. In the morning or rainy days, the rate of change in temperature of asphalt is high. In contrast, after the midday or sunny days, the rate of change in temperature of asphalt is low.\n",

            "description": "One of the primary concerns in paid microtask crowdsourcing systems is that of quality and reliability of the results produced. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing paradigm (regarding the quality of results produced, turnover time of the task) by inducing competence-based self-selection of microtasks among crowd workers. This means that workers would only work on the tasks that they believe they can complete based on their competence. To ensure that workers refrain from participating in microtasks that are beyond their competence, they first need to be aware of their limitations. By providing workers with an assessment of their competence in particular microtasks, we hypothesise that by providing competence-based feedback, workers will tend to pick tasks that are better for them. \nHere, we propose three experimental conditions: 1) control, 2) implicit, and 3) explicit. Control condition follows the normal workflow of a crowdsourcing platforms. For implicit and explicit experimental conditions, we implement two kinds of feedback mechanism systems implicit and explicit feedback. In these feedback designs, we provide different kinds of feedback to the workers. Here, we hypothesise that competence-based feedback delivered explicitly is more efficient than implicit methods of competence-based feedback.\nAnalysis of workers\u2019 data shows that 70% of the task selections are affected by explicit feedback with an overall accuracy of 70.59%. Where implicit feedback affected 59.35% of the task selection with an overall accuracy of 69.89%. On the other hand, workers of control condition provide overall accuracy of 50.69% with no feedback. Workers of the explicit and implicit experimental conditions took less time to finish the tasks compared to the workers of control experimental condition.\nCrowdsourcing marketplaces can significantly benefit from this, by training their workforce to progress towards higher competence and improved reputation.\n",
