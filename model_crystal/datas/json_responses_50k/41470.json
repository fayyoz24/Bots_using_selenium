As a logistician I was responsible for the logistical support for a field project, which entailed amongst others procurement and supply, security and incident management, transport and planning, maintenance and training communication equipment, water and sanitation, maintenance and construction buildings, contracts, HR management, financial administration and reports.\n\nLater as a Project Coordinator I assumed the end responsibility of a field project. I was responsible for the project planning, the development of policies, the project budget and the maintenance of a local network of contacts with local authorities and others.\n\nAfter that I took on me the position of Logistics Coordinator and became responsible for the logistical support to all projects in a country, whereby I coached the field logisticians from distance. Issues as import regulations, technical support to field teams, logistical budgets, coordination with other aid organisations, reaching targets and writing reports were added. I was part of the Country Management Team, which was responsible for the direction and policies of the projects in country. A quick flexible approach was needed to adapt to a dynamic context and to changing needs of the local population.",
