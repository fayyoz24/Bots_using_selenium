Taking the lead in several long-term projects to improve the quality of reporting and efficiency of the Financial Control department proved my added value. Among those projects were the introduction and implementation of intercompany reporting, cash flow-forecasting, purchase order processing and introducing a new sub- and top consolidation structure and method. In the last year working capital reporting became increasingly important and I was highly involved in the analysis and reporting process.",
