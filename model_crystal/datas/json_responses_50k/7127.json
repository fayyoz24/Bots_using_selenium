    "summary": "After 15 years of tinkering with design, technology, music and arts, I'm currently developing educational programs and workshops around synthesizers and sound art devices. This niche within product design offers a world of opportunities for creators, musicians and artists.\n\nNot only for music. Synthesizers are devices to shape and sculpt sound and visuals. They open a world of creative expression that can take the shape of an instrument, interactive installation, a sound art device and anything in between. Check out some of my posts for workshop results. \n\nI also give public talks and host the Synth Design Podcast - a weekly video interview with professional synthesizer designers and engineers to discuss human-centred Design (HCD), ergonomics, user experience and music technology.",

SXSW in Austin, Amsterdam Dance Event, and Primavera Pro in Barcelona to name a few. \n\nAs part of our initiatives we were invited to the World Intellectual Property Organization, to share our insights.
