                    "description": "In the last year of my Bachelor at the Hotel Management School Maastricht I did a management internship as Human Resources Trainee at Hotel Des Indes in The Hague. During this internship, I was responsible for the administrative tasks of the department as well as for the recruitment and selection process. Furthermore, I was involved in the on-boarding process of new employees and gave several trainings and workshops. Processing employee related information in various HR systems was also one of my tasks. Lastly, I gained insights into HR budgets and payroll systems. \n\nDuring this internship I worked together with the Human Resources Managers, since the HR department only consisted of one trainee and the HR manager herself. Because of this, I learned a lot about the Human Resources department. Together we were responsible for about 90 employees of the hotel and about 25 outsourced employees of the Housekeeping department. What I really liked about this internship is the fact that I knew every one of the employees and that I could see the results of our recruitment and selection process in the way of how the newly hired employees performed within their new teams. In addition, no day was the same and this was something I really appreciated.",
