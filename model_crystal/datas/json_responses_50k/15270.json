    "summary": "Hey! I\u2019m Sabrina, a design lead, UX designer and community organiser. \n\nCurrently I'm a Senior Product Design Manager at Moonpig. My main focus is leading & managing the team to help them grow and succeed and focusing on UX strategy to improve the UX department, like for example, by improving the growth path of a designer or setting up a vision for the team. \n\nI have experience with the whole product cycle, from translating the business and user\u2019s needs into viable solutions and validating the concepts until the implementation. Besides, I also have experience working with very complex systems and user flows.  \n\nI'm also the Chapter Lead of Ladies that UX Amsterdam. I believe in the power of communities and connecting with peers. My main responsibilities are finding venues and sponsors and organising the events. \n\nI\u2019m an advocate for accessibility, I truly believe that everyone should be able to use the internet regardless of their type of disability or situation. To me, accessibility is a basic human right. \n\nYou can contact me at sabrycouto@gmail.com",
