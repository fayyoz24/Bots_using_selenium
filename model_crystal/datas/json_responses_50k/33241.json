    "summary": "Experienced international trade analyst that worked directly with companies in Sweden, Scotland, Argentina, Brazil and Italy, now working on The Netherlands. At Pernod Ricard Brazil I could have Admin and Logistic experiences as well as Quality and International Commerce. Here I could hire 3 delightful people to work with me and implement the SAPI system together with Sao Paulo's team, we enhanced the distribution in Brazil and increased the department in Suape. At Costa Crociere (Italy) I could have more culture and language experiences, starting at the reception in a few months I was at the office of the cruise. Here I could organise better the files and timings for the Director. Now, working as International Sales Specialist I'm internationalising the whole company, which shows me my capacity to grow and work in a good pressure for introducing new products (Electromedical Devices for Communication) in new markets (after my arrival at Norway, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, India and Hungary). Also, in the meanwhile I'm investing my time helping people who want to come to Europe through my Youtube Channel and Instagram, giving them tips and showing them the World that sometimes they cannot see.",

Starting as an outside broker working alone at the Suape factory and finishing being hired as the leader of 3 people in the new International Trade Department in loco working under the manager located in Sao Paulo. I was the main contact to The Absolut Company, The Chivas Brothers and Beam Global companies and I was working directly with the Quality, Logistics, Production, Marketing, Selling and Supply Chain teams. Let's say the whole factory was involved as well as the broker. Some of the duties:\n\u2022 Implementation of SAP for the International TradeI Department (meeting in Argentina)\n\u2022 Inventory management: maintenance of healthy stocks, optimizations, safety stocks, prevention of back-orders, control of obsolete items, phase-in and phase-outs, etc.\n\u2022 Distribution of products between different warehouses, according to the sales forecast of each region.\n\u2022 Creation of import plans: indication of the products to be imported and their quantities, considering container's limits of space and weight. Also, contact to international suppliers to negotiate the delivery details.\n\u2022 Support the production plans through daily analysis comparing the plans versus sales to identify risks of breakdowns and, if needed, point out priorities.\n\u2022 Support the plans of national introduction of new foreign products, providing assistance such as setting deadlines and defining the best places to import the goods through.\n\u2022 Constant contact with the customer service, logistics and foreign trade teams to maintain daily operations.",
