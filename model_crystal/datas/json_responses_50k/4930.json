    "summary": "To make good policy decisions, good information is necessary, and as a researcher, I want to make this information available with the best possible research.\n\nI have a passion for research, and due to my work as a statistics tutor and several research projects at Tilburg University and the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen, I've become adept at setting up (experimental) studies, analysing data in SPSS and R, and conducting large-scale, scientific literature reviews.\n\nAs I combine this experience with a sharp eye for detail and get to the bottom of things, I deliver research of demonstrably high quality. For example, I presented the results of a research internship at a conference at the University of Edinburgh, and I am currently in the process of preparing my master's thesis for publiation in the journal of Language, Cognition and Neuroscience.\n\nAside from the fact that I work hard to deliver quality, I'm convinced it's necessary to also work smart, which is why I'm always looking for ways to innovate. For example, I have automated research tasks using Python, which ensured large quantities of raw data would be ready for analysis within mere seconds, while it would have taken hours or even days to by hand.\n\nFurthermore, as a statistics tutor, I have successfully helped numerous students perform statistical analyses for their thesis projects, which means I'm capable of quickly immersing myself in the details of new research projects, giving customised advice, and explaining the results of complex analyses in an understandable way to a broad audience.\n\nEmail: p.vonk@etil.nl",
