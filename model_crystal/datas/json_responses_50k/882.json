    "summary": "Johanna F\u00f6ldesi was born in 1986 in Gyula, Hungary. Growing up in D\u00e9vav\u00e1nya, she already started taking music lessons as a kid. In 2003 she began her studies in solo singing at the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Music School in B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba in the class of Erzs\u00e9bet Feichter. In 2005 after graduating from high school, she continued to take private lessons in Budapest with Zsolt Ol\u00e1h and in 2006 she was admitted to the Baptist Theological Academy  where she was chapel master, studying conducting. During the following years she actively served the baptist communities in her county as a musician. \n\nIn 2008 she continued her studies in the Netherlands at the Fontys Conservatoire in Tilburg, studying early music in the singing classes of Ildik\u00f3 Hajnal and Peggy Hegeman. The latter also introduced Johanna to the world of musical theatre. She obtained her master degree in 2014. \n\nDuring these years, at the masterclasses of Kinga Cserj\u00e9si and Heent Prins, she became acquainted with the Libero Canto Approach. This method of the Hungarian voice pedagogue Lajos Szamosi had a great influence on her, and ever since she has included its explored techniques into her professional singing and teaching. \n\nShe participated twice at the Sastamala Gregoriana masterclass in Finland, along with other masterclasses of Ian Honeyman, Johannette Zomer, Evelyn Tubb and Anna Az\u00e9ma. \n\nAlready during her studies, she performed regularly as a soloist. In 2012 she founded the early music ensemble Scherzi Musici, which still performs in the Netherlands. Besides taking into account the thorough historical background of their repertoire, the ensemble is especially willing to entertain.  \n\nJohanna is also active as a choir conductor in the Netherlands.  She doesn\u2019t restrict herself to the performing of early music, but enjoys exploring and singing a variety of styles. She especially appreciates challenging pieces and works written on special texts.",

Petrarca\u2019s sonnets are often put to music, but not in his own time. He lived in the 14th-century, in Italy and in South-France, where he was in service of the pope. This programme gives an impression of Petrarca\u2019s life, his work and the art of his world.\n\nAlso several artforms are combined as an experiment to give a context as well to the poetry as to the music. It was a common practise that jongleurs and musicians performed together at his time, and we would like to recall this tradition, adding a visual aspect with a modern circus performance.\n\nMembers of the ensemble: Esther Kronenburg, Johanna F\u00f6ldesi, Jan Janov\u010dik, Karel Barten, Maria Bayley, Galit Zadok (recorder), Miron Andres (vielle), Camille Paycha (acrobat) and Ruben Mardulier (acrobat)",

In these songs, love and life of the Hungarian heart resound, the songs speak of passion and longing, cherishing the warmth of a home, and the sight of cheerful peasants baking bread and young girls jokingly mocking young boys...\n\nBesides bringing joy for singers and, hopefully, audience alike, the content of this 60 min. programme was put together to pay homage to the composer who passed away 70 years ago. \n\nExcerpts of the programme:\nMad\u00e1rdal (\u201eBird song\u201d) \u2013 Bolyong\u00e1s (\u201eWandering\u201d) \u2013 B\u00e1nat (\u201eRegret\u201d) \u2013 Lev\u00e9l az otthoniakhoz (\u201eLetter to those at home\u201d) \u2013 Cip\u00f3s\u00fct\u00e9s (\u201eBreadbaking\u201d) \u2013 Resteknek n\u00f3t\u00e1ja (\u201eLoafer\u201d) \u2013 Le\u00e1nyn\u00e9z\u0151  (\u201eCourting\u201d) \u2013 J\u00e1t\u00e9k (\u201ePlay song\u201d) ...",

But Love shows up in many forms in our life: it can be sweet as honey, and at the same time it can be bitter as gall. Sometimes it mourns after a long lost lover or languishes from jealousy. It is full of lust, but also can be innocent as a child.\n\nPerforming:\nLaila Cathleen Neuman (soprano)\nJohanna F\u00f6ldesi (soprano)\nJ\u00e1n Janov\u010d\u00edk (tenor)\nKarel Barten (baritone)\nDavid Van Ooijen (theorbe)\n\nDate and time: 14 February (Saturday) at 19:30\nLocation: Lidwinakerk (Best)\n\nFor more detail, please check the following link: http://www.lidwinaconcerten.nl/",
