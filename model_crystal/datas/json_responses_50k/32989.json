Zeker gezien ontwikkelingen zoals de klimaatverandering, die grote invloed heeft op de waterhuishouding. We zetten nieuwe manieren in om milieuvriendelijk en duurzaam te werken. Door inzet van zon- en windenergie, energie uit (riool)water en uit biomassa zoals maaisel, willen wij energieneutraal werken vanaf 2025 en een bijdrage leveren aan de circulaire economie.
