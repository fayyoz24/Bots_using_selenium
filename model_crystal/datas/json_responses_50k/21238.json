    "summary": "Construction Management and Engineering (CME) student at TU Delft, currently completing my Master's degree. From my experience during the Civil Engineering Bachelor's studies and general information acquired from the field, I am very interested in finding ways to optimize project performance by means of applying optimization algorithms to project scheduling and planning. Currently my focus in the program of CME lies in analysis and optimization of design, engineering and project management processes both through the use of conventional project management theory and by use of Python and Matlab -based programming . As well as that, during my group project-oriented studies I have developed skills in group organization, public speaking and working with BIM modelling software, GIS-based programs, traffic simulation and Lifecycle Assessment programs like GaBi. Language skills: Russian (Native), English (Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency), Spanish (GCSE). My personal interests include philosophy, science fiction, winter mountain sports and self-education in music (bass and classic guitars).",
