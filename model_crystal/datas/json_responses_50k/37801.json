The main orientation of all buildings is strictly east-west with the main fa\u00e7ades (north & south) avoiding low-standing sun. Access to the campus by car remains on the existing road. A new main datum for pedestrian connection is established to form the heart of the campus. It spans between the mostly residential area in the north and the educational program in the south. The clusters of housing and education at the two opposite ends of the campus are surrounded by the lecturers houses, and leisure activities. Small neighbourhoods are formed by connecting some strips at the eastern end; the western buildings remain as strips and create courtyards by providing a terrace edge. For Cityfoerster.",

By having worked for over 8 years on high density, inner-city housing projects mainly in The Netherlands, Eric has gained indepth knowledge about designing, implementing building techniques and supervising construction sites, which made him familiar with the process of building from first sketch until final completion. Over the years, other building types like schools, healthcare, offices etc. became increasingly important in his portfolio, and thus expanding his knowledge. Since 2010, Eric has alternating been living and working in The Netherlands, USA, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Togo, Benin, Ethiopia, Somalia and Thailand, being able to adapt to, and gaining knowledge of, local circumstances concerning building regulations and construction conditions.",
