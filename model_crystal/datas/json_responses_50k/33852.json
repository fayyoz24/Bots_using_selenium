    "summary": "After taking a bit of time due to covid19 I decided for a change. The studio selling ecological and organic materials is closed now. And I only teach for a special project now and than. You can read more on my new website www.marijkebongers.com \n\nPlans for 2022: \n-Fashion activism, I have an online zoom group to support each other to recycle and mend. Using textile and clothes as a voice. Set ourselves free from the fashion industry, make storytelling clothes. /creating dreamscapes of a new way to live with our clothes. This year the theme is New Opulence. Making beauty from all the heaps of clothes and textile and making steps back to local materials. \n-Working on an exhibition at the Castellum Hoge Woerd spring and summer\nI rework my collection, make a lot of samples in plantdyed materials and will have a textile lab. Also there will probably be two installations in the pluktuin. \n-I joined a citizens science project about old dye books of the Textielmuseum Tilburg (exhibition and workshops from April)\n-And I work on the rebranding of Indigo Fashion nl making together with the owner Caroline Nijland a plan for her collection made of Indigo and mudcloth fabric from West-Africa with a handmade Dutch touch. The collection will contain some unique items to wear and for the home. We will present the collection in June on Xtant at Mallorca",

We make them so that they can be plant dyed by us and we make them in separate pieces so you can wear these precious clothes for a long long time. We will show these outfits at 6th October at the Fair Fashion Festival in Utrecht (the Netherlands)\nWe also work on the Kimono-project in a group of talented women we invited to work with. \"The Conscious Women Society\" We make kimono coats that you can wear at two sides with personal quotes or decoration in embroidery or other technics. The first coat was handspun and handwoven by Caitlin Bongers, and I (Marijke Bongers) sewed it all by hand and lined it with hand dyed organic, fair and cruelty free silk. Two other coats are worked on right now. One with the hand weaver Mieke de Bruijn. The yarns are mostly spun by Caitlin again, and I will sew it together and do the embroidery.\nNext to that we want our studio to be a place of inspiration and a place where you can still buy fair, organic or very special materials. We test them all ourselves.\nIn our classes we can teach you old skills like sewing, embroidery, knitting, plant dyeing, crochet and spinning.\nIt is also possible to make your own fair organic (bridal)outfit with a bit of help. We think it is possible if you let us help you with fittings and more. This makes fair, organic and bespoke so much more available and might add to the value you give too your clothes.\nPlease have a look at our website: www.ecotextilestudio.com\nIn the link you can find our book with pictures of the last photoshoot. The model is Nienke Wind of Introdans and the photographer is Timon Both Fotografie.",

Like fashion a lot of craft textile is not an ethical choice. Next to this I visited an art centre in Finland and realised that like in Finland, craftsmanship and little shops with materials disappeared quick in our own village too. This led to the decision to have open studio on Friday and Saturdays. On those days we sell eco friendly and fairtrade yarns and textiles. The rest of the week I work on patterns, develop new possibilities with old technics give classes and write tutorials. Read further on our website    www.ecotextilestudio.nl",
