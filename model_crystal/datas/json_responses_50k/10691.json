In the past years the number of data initiatives and the amount of data that is being produced in the city has increased significantly. While the amount of data is increasingly growing the meaning or purpose of these amount of data is not always clear. More often there is a need to give meaning and purpose to this data.\n\nBy not only storing data but in order to give meaning to this data there is a need to analyse and visualize in order to get meaningful insights from this data. For this track we will not be focusing on the gathering and storage of (big) data sets. Instead we will be using already existing large and structured datasets and API\u2019s to analyse and visualize for a purpose. This will mean we will be exploring ways to analyse the datasets (Data Analytics), Visualize and design these datasets (Data Visualization) and explore how these methods can be used to support and accelerate a societal transformation. Within this track we will be experimenting, researching and prototyping new ways of using data for societal transformations.",
