The programme will improve post-ops processes, data analysis and traffic prediction to optimise the effectiveness of ATM decision making and to improve the planning and the execution of daily operations. As a result, flows will be optimally routed through the MUAC airspace so that workload is balanced across the sectors and traffic is streamlined before it reaches the ATCO to operate safely and efficiently",

PRANET, mainly used for civil purposes, aiming for increased availability of surveillance data throughout the country, is installed in a redundant architecture, provided by an underlying red and a green IP-based network. \nEach radar source feeds both the green and red network via two PRANET nodes, located at different sites; a strategy to prevent loss of radar data in case of a catastrophic failure of any particular site or communication link and to ensure an ultimate high degree of permanent availability of any radar service, at any place, any time.

This initiative expands and replaces MUAC\u2019s previous flagship programme called ATC2ATM. The CONOPS 2030 major objective is to have built-in flexibility to plan sta and the airspace more eciently while optimising performance. Alongside traditional metrics like safety, cost, capacity, productivity, and delays, we will consider our customers\u2019 preferences and the impact of our operations on the environment.\n\nATC2ATM programme intends to introduce an evolution in the concept of operations, including new roles, procedures and tools bridging the gap between the ATFCM and ATC functions and making the most efficient use of staff and airspace. The programme will improve post-ops processes, data analysis and traffic prediction to optimise the effectiveness of ATM decision making and to improve the planning and the execution of daily operations. As a result, flows will be optimally routed through the MUAC airspace so that workload is balanced across the sectors and traffic is streamlined before it reaches the ATCO to operate safely and efficiently",

The central communication nodes RMCDE, forming the cornerstones of PRANET and processing and distributing regional, national and international radar data, installed in Gdansk, Poznan, Katowice and two sites in the capital of Warsaw. \nIn the context of a contract from PANSA German ATC/ATM specialist COMSOFT deployed a total of nine RMCDEs (Radar Message Conversion & Distribution Equipment) for this ambitious enhancement project. PRANET, mainly used for civil purposes, aiming for increased availability of surveillance data throughout the country, is installed in a redundant architecture, provided by an underlying red and a green IP-based network. \nEach radar source feeds both the green and red network via two PRANET nodes, located at different sites; a strategy to prevent loss of radar data in case of a catastrophic failure of any particular site or communication link and to ensure an ultimate high degree of permanent availability of any radar service, at any place, any time.
