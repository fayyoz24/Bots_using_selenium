    "summary": "I\u2019m a young energetic student at Erasmus University currently pursuing my master\u2019s course in Econometrics and Management science starting this year. First of all, I\u2019m really excited and a bit nervous as it is my first time outside my native country to pursue higher studies and I look forward experiencing this new journey of life along with making new friends, visit various places in Europe and much more.\n\nI started with my Pre-masters studies in Econometrics and Management science last year and gained knowledge in a wide range of subjects which includes Statistics/Advanced Stats, Micro-economics, Econometrics, Markov, Linear programming, time series and so on. With each course, I was able to learn on how to analysis the data, how to proceed and solve a given problem, learn about different models used in econ to solve a given problem and how to explain your results in the best-easiest way to other people. As a pre-master student I studied most of the Bachelors\u2019 Courses that helped me understood the minute details of different courses thus widening my interest in various opportunities that I can find in my Econometrics field. \n\nAfter finishing up with my pre-masters studies, i started with my masters with specialization in business analytics and quantitative marketing. I studied and went through vigorous training exercises in various subjects/modules which includes Bayesian econometrics, Micro-econometrics, Advanced marketing model, Multivariate statistics, seminar case study and so on. In the 4th block of my masters, i started my internship with Unilever and got the opportunity to write my thesis along with my internship. The topic of my thesis was \"Prediction of market share of FMCG products using market share attraction model.\" \n\nHere, at the Erasmus University, I\u2019ve worked in ESN\u2019s (ERASMUS STUDENT NETWORK) marketing committee as a Digital Marketing Specialist where I\u2019ve been involved with the various marketing strategies we create for our events including creating and managing the newsletter of the ESN organization, promotion of cultural, social and business events and so on.\n\nAt last, I would say that I am an enthusiastic, flexible, hard-working person who is quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others. Plus, the tasks and responsibilities that I\u2019ve undertook and completed over the years have helped me to improve at every stage of my life. I devote my time and commitment in every task and work responsibility given to me and my past experience in professional field acts as a catalyst in providing the best qualitative and efficient work.",
