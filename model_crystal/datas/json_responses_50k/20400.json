    "summary": "I've worked in/with SMEs and startups throughout my career as I tend to prefer working closely with a small tight-knit team. I am sort of a jack of all trades and I can hardly think of a business-related task I didn\u2019t do at one point or another from wiping the office floor to running a company. My strongest suit however has been Operations and Project Management.\nWorking closely with developers has rubbed off on me, and I am currently honing my technical skills while attempting a career switch towards web development.\nAside from reading and writing, I love forming meaningful connections with fellow humans, picking the brains of intelligent people (I prefer being the least smart person in the room), and learning new skills and subjects.
