    "summary": "Are you looking for a person that is willing to work the full 100% for your company, has excellent customer service skills, Hospitality, Sales, F & B skills, is a go-getter, and has a problem-solving mentality? When you are ready to hire an ambitious and passionate teammate for this purpose, consider me for the position. By hiring me into the company, you will have yourself a hardworking -and eager team member who is willing to assist you in your mission.\n\nI like to stay healthy by exercising daily, eat healthily, and I love to travel whenever I get a chance. I was born and raised in Aruba and started working while studying at a very young age. My home town is very popular for tourism and its beaches and tourism and hospitality are taught to us already at a very young age also in school and at home. I come from an entrepreneurial family and have worked in the tourism industry and also at both my parents' businesses, both very successful in Aruba. I have learned at firsthand how to manage a successful Property management company in Aruba with over 300 vacation homes and house rentals. I also worked at my fathers' restaurant as an all-around restaurant assistant and host.  \nI have been living for almost 5 years in Holland where I have studied and worked as well. I am looking to gain more skills and broaden my horizons by living and working abroad and prefer to do so in Europe. I enjoy meeting new people, learning about new cultures, and enjoy having a stimulating and motivating environment around me. \n\nDo you have a position available? \nIf so, I hope you give me the opportunity and see if we can mean something for each other. \n\nI am currently in Rotterdam and plan to stay in Europe.",
