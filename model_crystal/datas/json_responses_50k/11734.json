    "summary": "Martijn Tellinga (The Netherlands, 1974) is an artist, composer and occasional performer. His practice occupies an intermedium between music composition, spatial installation and durational performance. Drawn from a reduced formalist-seeming vocabulary, his works pose reflections on the basic mechanisms of compositional form \u2014often inquiring into modes of repetition, seriality and patterning\u2014, and the musical agency of an evolving materiality and contextuality. They are commonly produced by means of some self-evolving system, a processual organisation, open-ended durational arrangement or site-specific dynamics, which in turn are tuned to propel perceptual, performative and social interactions. Much of his work is score-based and includes a wide variety of conceptual actions and chance operations, probing the emergent field between intended and accidental occurrences.\n\nThe spatial, performance and intervention-type works he produced in recent years, have increasingly aligned his output with emerging propositions for an expanded, post-media music practice. His current activities focus on how to read principles of musical structure, temporality and process to approach the multifaceted construct of installation, rendering musical work which activates site-adaptive movement and performative action, moving image and registrative techniques, text, and the architectural setting. Through such speculative musical spaces, an extended musicality is proposed: how can musical ideas travel between and convey through different mediums and situations, and function as a generative and experiential devise beyond sound and the concert setting? \n\nHe received a Master\u2019s degree in Sonology and multiple Stipends for Established Artists from the Mondriaan Fund. He is currently a funded PhD candidate at GradCAM in Dublin, Ireland. He presents worldwide, lectures and works in residence. He has articulated his artistic research through the development of courses around the spatial, processual and environmental modalities of sound informed practices. This led to visiting professorships at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, China and ArtEZ Academy in Arnhem, The Netherlands.\n\nHe is one of the curator producers of the long running series DNK-Amsterdam. With DNK Ensemble he interprets and re-enacts seminal pieces on the edge of experimental music, performance art and installation, from the likes of Antoine Beuger, Cornelius Cardew, David Dunn, Dick Raaijmakers, Anthony McCall, David Tudor.\n\nHe lives and works in Amsterdam, Netherlands.",

This concept is animated, and animates, through scoring. The development of a score-based, event approach to installation is central to the study. It allows to speculatively probe the implications and possibilities raised by the question if and how non-sounding agencies can express musical form and musicality by entering into composition with both the sounding and the silent, the \u2018musical\u2019 and the \u2018non-musical\u2019.\n\nMy research will be supervised by Noel Fitzpatrick, Tim Stott and Connor McGarrigle.

The artistic highlight of the this studio was the 'Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique', an automated performance with image, color, and electronic music in a building designed by Iannis Xenakis for the Brussels World Fair in 1958. Philips decided in 1960 that the Research Laboratories could no longer house a studio which was becoming a workplace for composers and less a means of meeting direct corporate needs. The studio was transferred to the Utrecht University. Since 1961, Gottfried Michael Koenig came regularly to the Netherlands as a speaker during the yearly Gaudeamus Music Week in Bilthoven where he also started a course on electronic music in the garden house of the Walter Maas House. In 1964, Koenig became artistic director of the Institute of Sonology. In 1986,  it was incorporated in the Royal Conservatory in the Hague. In addition to the one-year course, a four-year conservatory major and a two-year Masters are now offered.",
