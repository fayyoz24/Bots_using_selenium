Following that, we optimize the product offering in such a manner passengers have choice and control over the level of flexibility in their purchased ticket. \n\n(b) Time2Think - in which we give passengers the opportunity to freeze their chosen offer for 72h maximum before guaranteeing their trip. Like this, we can provide passengers, when in doubt, with some extra time to decide whether this ticket is the right suit for them.\n\nNext to that, I am also involved in various topics around conciergerie propostions for Air France as well as projects concerning seating.",
