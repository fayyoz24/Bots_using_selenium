Realising lots of it is a team effort, I enjoy being a linking pin, exploring synergies and connecting stakeholders. \n\nWith work and leisure I have been privileged to live many years abroad. This allowed me to develop an international, flexible and open mindset. I get energy out of establishing international relations and business and love to be challenged by a dynamic and global environment.\n\nI am highly organized and thoroughly enjoy to strategise, plan and prioritise.  I happily bite my teeth into optimising processes by mapping out bottlenecks and tackling them one-by-one!\n\n\n\n\n",
