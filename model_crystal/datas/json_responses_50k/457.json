    "summary": "The continuous challenge of doing my job is what keeps me energised. I am a professional and dynamic business developer that is always ready to go the extra mile in order to achieve his goals. Things might get tough, but I am not  afraid to get my hands dirty to overcome the situation and find the right solutions.\n\nThe world is changing faster than our clocks are ticking and we as individuals have the important role to set its course. During my studies and international work experiences in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Bogota I was able to connect with amazing people from all around the world that have changed my perception of how \"we\"  as humans  interact with each other. Besides this, I was also able to broaden my knowledge and develop a major interest for supply chain management, IT, omnichannel, partner program and systems implementation. \n\nI would describe myself as a chameleon that can adapt in the easiest way to the most difficult circumstances. I can work under pressure and I always appreciate it when I get feedback from others. If there's a chance to learn and apply my knowledge; I will always take it.  \n\nIf you would like to get in touch, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nemail address: leonardo.vasquez.info@gmail.com",
