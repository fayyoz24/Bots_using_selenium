    "summary": "Some 10 years ago, my career journey started and it took me through some wonderful places & employers of all kinds. Could I have imagined back then that today I will be working for such a fantastic employer as Albelli as the Head of Sales & Operations Planning?\n\nIt all began with a trip away from my home country, Bulgaria. This journey was born out of a small aspiration - to experience the world. After once participating in a student exchange program, my passion for work and travel was ignited and during my Bachelor degree I enrolled for a student exchange program in the USA on another 3 occasions.\n\nIn 2015, I obtained my Bachelor\u2019s degree in Finance and Financial management in Sofia. An year later I decided to move to the Netherlands and to study at Erasmus University, Rotterdam. The next two years I spent studying, while working full-time, and in the end I graduated successfully with a Master\u2019s degree in Economics and Business, specialising in urban, port and transport economics.\n\nCurrently, I am based in Rotterdam and working on my own projects as a freelancer. For the past two years I\u2019ve been working at Albelli, where I recently got promoted from a Financial role to be the company\u2019s new Head of S&OP.",
