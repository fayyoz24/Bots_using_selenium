    "summary": "Hi there \ud83c\udf3b, \n\nWelcome to my profile!\nMy story in a nutshell starts from a small town in Bulgaria and led me to exploring the beautiful canals of the Netherlands. A Psychology Bachelor in Erasmus University Rotterdam and one pandemic later, my passion for people and communication led me to working in the field of Recruitment. I am currently part of the amazing, international team at WeAreKeen, where I focus on executing a full recruitment cycle, as well as strategizing on challenging internal projects on the side. \n\nExploring the fields of Psychology and Recruitment made me discover a true passion of mine: making an impact in people's professional & personal lives. As an international I know how difficult it could be to integrate in a foreign working market and try finding your place & passion while going through this process. And so, after finishing up the last interview of the day, I hop on calls aiming to help young professionals find their place in the working market by sharing tips & tricks on how to land your first job, make your CV & LinkedIn flashy for all my fellow recruiter colleagues or by just having a quick brainstorm coffee chat about what the best next career step would look like and how to reach it.\n\nEnough about me! If you are: \n\ud83c\udf3b having troubles finding your next step and you need some guidance \n\ud83c\udf3b you enjoy a good laugh while exploring career opportunities \n\ud83c\udf3b a recruiter or career advisor/coach that wants to share some insights \n\nFeel free to connect and drop a message!",
