    "summary": "I moved to the Netherlands from California in May 2020 and I plan to live long term in the Netherlands. With the move, I left my previous job as a Panel Production Scientist II at Roche Molecular Diagnostics. My position at Roche required daily use of various laboratory and project management techniques. During my time as a Project Lead making clinical panels for Roche PCR assays and as a Research Associate at OptiScan Biomedical working to test a blood glucose monitoring system, I have gained extensive laboratory experience in multiple molecular, cellular, and microbiological techniques. I am currently taking private lessons to learn Dutch and I am between an A2 and B1 fluency level. I received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Biochemistry from San Francisco State University and I have completed a project management overview course through UC Berkeley Extension. I plan to pursue a certification in project management and continue working in the biotech industry.",

During my time as Welfare Officer: I modified the snack bar and raffle fundraisers to be easier to conduct while increasing the funds raised, started a monthly birthday email announcement, created a club Facebook page after which all obedience classes were full, managed the annual holiday parties, and put on casual club member hangouts. I stepped down from the position in January 2019 as I was moving."
