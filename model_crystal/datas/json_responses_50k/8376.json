    "summary": "Senior Group Leader with significant multi-national experience in research and industrial application of microbiology and molecular biology.\n\nThe study of the peptides and genetics of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from breweries was my passport to industrial microbiological research supplemented with the latest molecular biological technologies around the world and now to leading a dynamic team in Ecolab.  Understanding and controlling microbes is more important than ever and I\u2019ve had the opportunity to study and work with institutes and companies to develop this expertise.\n\nHaving worked for Ecolab and Heineken in various locations, consistently delivering project goals on time and in budget whilst fully meeting stakeholders\u2019 expectations, I further developed my core strengths of:\n\u2022\tCross functional team leadership\n\u2022\tProject management, and\n\u2022\tMicrobiology and molecular biology specialist knowledge.\n\nIn academia, I have mentored students, supervised research projects and delivered lectures on:\n\u2022 Industrial Microbiology,\n\u2022 Medical Microbiology,\n\u2022 Environmental Microbiology\n\u2022 Biotechnology, and\n\u2022 Food Microbiology including beer, dairy and cocoa fermentation.\n\nDue to my international experience, I have gained an understanding of different cultural perspectives. This, plus a drive to face challenges head on, learn new things and broaden my horizons, enabled me to work in each country I have lived in - overcoming legal (work permits) as well as cultural and language obstacles.\n\nMy key achievements to date include:\n\u2022 Designing and leading organisational restructuring and change management.\n\u2022 Being part of an innovation team which led to a globally recognized product.\n\u2022 Managing the implementation of rapid microbiological detection assays worldwide.\n\u2022 Ensuring product quality and assessing product risk, resulting in difficult decisions yet maintaining good working relationships with the teams involved.\n\u2022 Adapting and challenging myself in new situations such as going from academia to industry, gaining expertise in diverse fields as brewing, medical microbiology, tropical ecology, chocolate and biocides.\n\u2022 Developing strong team capabilities and mentoring students.\n\nI enjoy solving problems and constantly learning.\n",
