I have built this experience across varied roles in both practice and blue-chip industry environments. I am also adept in partnering with commercial managers to influence business growth decisions, whilst my exceptional communication skills and personable character enable me to collaborate effectively with a broad range of internal stakeholders and clients. \n\nKey achievements\n\u2022\tIn a commercial business partnering role, identified and implemented profit improvement plans for poorly performing insurance brokers. 7 out of 8 identified brokers turned around into profitability the next year.\n\u2022\tProvided financial insight and advice on financial performance to account managers which enabled constructive negotiations resulting in two of AXA\u2019s largest partners turning a profit for the first time in 3&4 years respectively in 2021.\n\u2022\tPartnering with stakeholder across the business including the FD, cost centre managers and account managers, I consistently delivered clear and accurate cost budgets and insightful variance analysis over multiple periods. \n\u2022\tIn my role as an expense controller I oversaw the re-design, implementation and roll-out of a new payroll process after a breach which is still in place today.\n\u2022\tWorking for an international company in recent years, I have developed close relationships and understandings with colleagues around the world, including in France, India and Japan. \n\u2022\tHighly motivated to help others succeed.
