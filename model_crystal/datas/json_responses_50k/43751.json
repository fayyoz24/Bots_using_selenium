    "summary": "Lois Fern\u00e1ndez M\u00edguez holds a BSc and an MSc. degree in Physics from the University of Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, Spain). He finished his Master Studies in 2020, where he specialized in Condensed Matter Physics. In his Master Thesis, he studied the suitability of some Ionic Liquids as new-gen battery electrolytes.\n\nIn 2021 he started his PhD program in the M2N Research group of Prof. R.A.J Janssen. Lois research focuses on Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) Photolithography. This program is being carried out under the supervision of Prof. Dr. R. Coehoorn and Prof. Dr. P.A. Bobbert and in close collaboration with Simbeyond B.V., as well as other universities and private companies.\n\nLois is now developing a validated model of the EUV process that will be included in a software tool. This software tool will allow its users to carry out virtual photolithography experiments, providing predictions beyond what is currently experimentally accessible.",
