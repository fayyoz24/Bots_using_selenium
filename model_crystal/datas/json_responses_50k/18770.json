    "summary": "Creative & Innovative Digital Marketing Specialist with over 6 years of professional experience. \nI have developed my career in social media, content marketing, brand building & positioning, influencers & affiliate marketing, and more. Originally from Spain, today I am located in the Netherlands while able to deliver results remotely. \n\nCurrently, I am taking on the next step in my career as a MarCom lead at Cevinio, an AP automation SaaS solution. In my role, I am responsible for the creation and execution of our marketing and business development strategies. I ensure that our business is brought to the attention of existing and potential customers on brand using various online and offline marketing and communication tools.\n\nJust before, I worked as Global Brand Content Specialist for strollers for the brands Maxi-Cosi and Quinny. I was responsible for supporting new product introductions with the right digital content. Next to this, I managed Quinny's global social media channels, from strategy to community management; global influencer initiatives supporting local activations, and I was co-leading digital innovations for our brands: in 2020 we activated several innovations on social media that improved brand awareness, consideration, and conversion. \n\nDay to day I put to work my creative skills orienting my work to be efficient, data-driven, research-based, and aligned with the business objectives. My goal is to improve our performance through the customer journey by activating the right digital communications. This allows us to better invest our sources while ensuring we collect the desired results. \n\nRegarding my education, I have a dual bachelor's degree in Communication & PR and Marketing from CEU University in Spain. In 2016 I earned the final bachelor's degree award as the best student of marketing. I own a masters in SEO, and over the past years, I have done several courses on digital marketing and influencers. I am currently studying Facebook Blueprint in Creative Strategy. \n\nYou will meet a strategic and analytical digital communication specialist, with outstanding creative skills, flexibility, and resilience. I can work in fast-paced environments while being able to prioritize, multitask, and manage a high workload. I am an adaptable professional with a positive and can-do attitude, able to motivate and inspire others. I would also highlight my entrepreneurial mindset and ability to work independently as well as on a team.",

I applied to that plan in order to start my professional path as well as start to get some experience. Fortunately, I got it. \nI worked as a communication trainee at Llumy, a B2B oriented company with a special business unit for the retail market. My main responsibilities there were helping with the marketing and communication plan, assisting the owners with their new website, from content to design, and managing social networks",
