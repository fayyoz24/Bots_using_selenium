P2P-lending is a financing strategy similar to crowdfunding, however focussed on the personal loans of individuals. Craddit is unique as investors / lenders are restricted by their social connections; only first- and second-tier connections on social media are allowed to invest. With Craddit we participated in the Dutch nine-month business-plan competition New Venture, where we ended within the 40 best entrepreneurs out of 400 competitors",
