    "summary": "My research focuses on creating opportunities for inclusive development and knowledge production. I am interested particularly in improving opportunities for education and mental wellbeing in children and youth. I have experience with- and written papers, regarding various Transdisciplinary Action Research projects on e.g. disability inclusion (in Ethiopia), suicide prevention and stress-free parenting (Pune, India), mental health of women (Banyan, Chennai, India), Innovation in Higher Education (MITWPU, Pune) and child protection in The Netherlands. As research consultant I have experience in evaluating parenting programs for NGOs (Save the Children in India, Nepal and Philippines). I am passionate about helping to improve educational opportunities for children and youth, and the mental wellbeing of marginalised groups, through community-based interventions. I mentor PhD students as well as MA students in the field of Global Health.  I have also co-created two Winter Schools for researchers for LOVA Amsterdam on the relationship between feminism and motherhood.",

Feedback from our past Winter and Summer Schools underlines the pleasure of intensively working and developing new ideas with a small, dedicated group within an anti-hierarchical environment. The event is designed for everyone who is interested: both lifelong learners as well as students and more established scholars. The Winter School is shorter than you are used to in our Summer Schools. By making it a four-day event (including the weekend) we hope to ease the possibility of attendance for participants.",

CSSP encompasses child-focused or family-based social protection programmes that directly or indirectly address children\u2019s needs and rights through a combination of social protection and complementary interventions.   Based on the understanding that complementary interventions to social protection will ensure better results on child development outcomes, a crucial part of CSSP is to promote improved care and investment in children among parents and other caregivers.   Save the Children has  therefore introduced parenting programmes as an integral part of the CSSP initiatives. In Nepal, India and the Philippines, the parenting packages are focused on improving the relationship between the parent/ caregiver and the child and the parenting concepts developed under the International Child Development (ICDP) programme are used as a foundation for this. In addition, there are sessions in the package that have been added, which are of particular relevance to the local context and the social protection programme in focus.  \n\nTo understand the impact of the sessions on parents and children as comprehensibly as possible, quantitative as well as qualitative assessments are carried out.  As a qualitative research consultant I help evaluate the outcomes of the parenting sessions in the localities. The qualitative assessment is important to capture nuances and intricacies of parenting behaviour and outcomes for children that are difficult to assess otherwise.",

                    "description": "I completed my PhD study on academic stress in India in november 2017 at the VU University in Amsterdam. My thesis entitled 'The most stressful period of my life; understanding and preventing academic stress in urban, middle-class Indian youth', addresses stress from a social-ecological perspective, and deeply explores the themes of community based health, parenting, education and wellbeing, particularly in a rapidly developing and diverse urban Indian setting. As part of this work I also worked closely together with NGOs, parents, mental health professionals and schools/universities, to develop feasible, interactive and sustainable interventions for youth as well as parents, to empower them to cope better with stressful life events. Some of the lessons we learned from these programs were furthermore shared through a video project, for which four story lines were developed, to scale-up the working mechanisms in a broader context. \n\nI also worked as an educator in the master programs Management Policy Analysis (MPA) and International Public Health (IPH), as well as various bachelor programs at VU University.",
