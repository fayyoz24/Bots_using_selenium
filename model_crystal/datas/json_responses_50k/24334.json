By using an automated versioning system, Riccardo was able to ensure that consuming parties have the correct version. Riccardo also introduced writing unit tests and end-to-end tests by using Jest and Playwright respectfully. He did this within the engineering teams by doing pairing sessions, PR reviewing, demonstrations and coaching. The teams now are self-sufficient and confident to pick up new functionality in React. They are able to deploy multiple times a day automatically to production without needing anyone from outside the team.",

This led to greater clarity in delivering components from design, through the frontend to the backend. I enjoyed aligning developers with our delivery mission. Creating a CI/CD pipeline, defining a versioning strategy, building a mono repo, using a shared component library are a few highlights. \n\nLater in the project, I was more involved in development activities, such as building features for end-users. Web components displayed on the website, such as a slider and an input search box to name a few. During this time, I was also connecting a lot to other teams to share knowledge and align proposed solutions in order to maintain and improve the overall software quality. One of the outcomes was that we used shared components to provide Vattenfall content managers an end-user experience. \n\nFinally, I am also very proud to have realized a handlebars solution with Hans Kerkhof. We brought frontend and backend closer together, by reducing HTML duplication, complexity and error-proneness.",

Although there were technical causes to the performance issues, I pointed out the underlying cause: communication in and between development teams.  I started outside the teams to take on both the technical and interpersonal challenges. I felt a solution architect was needed to carry out the decisions and justifications of the teams to a broader level within the organization and managed to get one of the team members appointed.  \n\nAnother tackled issue was the differing branching strategy between the teams on the same repository. I created two poster-sized drawings that represented how the teams should do branching. This resulted in team members gathering near the drawings to solve any remaining unclarities.  \n\nOther achievements I am proud of are: AngularJS client-side caching, TDD workshops, local end to end debugging and moving the teams to increase unit testing.",
