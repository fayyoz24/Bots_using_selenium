    "summary": "As an environmental engineering Master's student with a background in mechanical engineering, I have developed a deep passion for sustainability and environmental physics. I have always been fascinated by the ways in which engineering can be applied to address environmental challenges and improve sustainability, and my studies have allowed me to explore these interests further.  An exciting project I have been involved in is researching mesoscale cloud organization in the trades in collaboration with KNMI. This project has allowed me to delve into the intricacies of the atmosphere and gain a better understanding of how the physics of the environment interact with one another. It has been fascinating to work on this research and contribute to the broader understanding of environmental systems. I am intrigued by the process of discovery, and the opportunity to explore new ideas and develop new knowledge.\n\nI am a disciplined and motivated person, with a strong commitment to hard work and enthusiasm for learning. I am always eager to explore new ideas and approaches. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the field of environmental engineering and contributing to research efforts that have the potential to create real-world impact. I am confident that my background in mechanical engineering and passion for sustainability and environmental physics will serve me well in this pursuit.",
