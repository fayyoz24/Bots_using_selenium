After 2 years of work experience as an architect, I decided to switch to the design field that focuses on improving user experiences. I finished a UX/UI boot camp with Ironhack, and since August 2022, I have worked as a UX/UI Designer.\n\nThanks to my architectural background and analytical mindset, I have an eye for detail, quality, and well-organized designs. I also understand how important good communication with stakeholders and the team is, and I find that collaborating with software developers from the earliest stage of the design gives the best results.",
