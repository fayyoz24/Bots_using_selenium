    "summary": "Friso van der Veen was appointed Full Professor of Experimental Physics at ETH-Z\u00fcrich in May 2000. He was head of the Research Department of Synchrotron Radiation and Nanotechnology at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and Deputy Director of PSI. Born in 1949 in The Netherlands, he graduated at the University of Utrecht and received his PhD in 1978 with a thesis on a surface science topic. After spending in 1979 a year as postdoc at IBM Yorktown Heights, he joined in 1980 the staff at the FOM-Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics in Amsterdam. In 1997 he was appointed full professor at the Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute of the University of Amsterdam. \nHis research interests lie in the application of synchrotron x-ray scattering techniques for studies of the structural properties of solid-liquid interfaces and of confined fluid films. He has (co-)authored more than 240 publications in peer-reviewed journals, which led to ca 10000 citations (h-index 53). He retired in 2014.",
