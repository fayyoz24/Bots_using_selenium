I am an accomplished hands-on B2B & B2C marketing practitioner, grounded in the principles of data-driven decision-making, who transitioned into operations to drive digital transformation across marketing. Task-orientated and solutions-focused, I am driven by the desire to meet new challenges every day. \n\nI am used to working in complex, high-pressure, global companies where maximizing Marketing ROI is imperative to stay competitive and meet business goals. Having built corporate websites, mobile applications, brand/demand generation campaigns, personalized nurture tracks, sales enablement, and channel partner programs across multiple languages, I am familiar with the touch points of the customer journey. I helped establish and operate paid media competence centers, B2B demand centers, and Marketing performance measurement teams throughout my career.   \n\nI thrive on personal interaction with people from diverse backgrounds, nationalities, and skill sets. I have learned to appreciate that working in a team of complementing individuals will get you further, faster, and more personally rewarding. By means of diplomacy and enthusiasm, I positively encourage my teams to drive projects efficiently. Applying advanced planning, roadmap development, project management, and forecasting skills while simultaneously managing competing priorities helps me ensure that projects are delivered on time and within budget.",
