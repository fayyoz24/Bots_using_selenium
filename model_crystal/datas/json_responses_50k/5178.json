    "summary": "Bachelor student with an ever-present passion in and dedication to sustainability in all its aspects. Professionally,  my main ambition is to substantially integrate socially and environmentally responsible development into the corporate world, and therefore into people\u2019s lives. As I aspire to achieve this through creativity and innovation, I started a bachelor in Economics & International Business. I am entrepreneurial, have a very hands-on mentality and am fascinated by the psychological dimension of marketing and management and strive to advance my research in this area. When facing let downs, persevering and staying confident till the end are key to my work ethics. Eager to learn and disciplined to handle great amounts of responsibility with minimum guidance and supervision is a courtesy of the problem based learning (PBL) system and the emphasis on independent, critical thinking at Maastricht University, for which I am immeasurably grateful. My mixed Russian-Arabian origin and subsequent assimilation into Western society enables me to familiarize and orientate in a multitude of distinctive cultural settings. I am interested in positions in sustainability consultancy, green banking and the creative industry. Through working with different sustainable student associations of Maastricht University such as Enactus and VSA, I gained many valuable skills such as working collaboratively in a proactive and independent way, project management and deep analysis of social media trends. Now being in my third and last year of the Economics and Business Bachelor in Maastricht, I am in search of an internship that will offer opportunities to expand my knowledge on sustainability and business.",
