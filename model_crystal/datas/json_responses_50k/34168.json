That represents around 11000km through: Patagonia, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Nicaragua.\nDuring this part, I was trekking a lot through all the Andes, and imerging into cultures and villages that I met along the road and with the people I hitchhiked with.\n\n> Volunteering in a farm in the North of Patagonia, Chile. See the Rupanco farm in \"VOLUNTEERS\" section.\n\n> Boathike from Copenhagen to Oslo. \nI was giong on the harbours to ask if I could go up north on people's boats, helping on the maneuvers, and with the daily tasks. \nI went all the way up from Copenhagen to Oslo through Sweden, and then back to south of France hitchhiking, along Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France.\nThis represents around 3000km, 600km on the sea and 2300 on the land.\n\n> All in all this trip represents 14000km in 1 year. I had a daily budget of 20USD for accomodation, food and activities. It helped me to live on a tight budget, to be responsible of my decisions and to be autonomous.",
