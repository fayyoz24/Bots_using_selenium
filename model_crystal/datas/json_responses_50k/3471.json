This allows measurement and comparison of per\u2010kilometre risk, rather than only injury numbers (important because high numbers of injuries may primarily indicate high numbers of cyclists). Results and analysis will be used to develop case studies, events, and guidance to communicate implications for policy and practice. This project has a good chance of affecting policy given the high profile of cycling safety (recent DfT review) and need for better evidence to inform policy.\nThe main beneficiary will be people cycling, vulnerable road users whose injury risk remains high. The project will enable mapping of cycling risk across route networks in any given area, based on route environment characteristics associated with elevated or reduced risk. This will enable transport authorities to pro\u2010actively prevent injuries before they occur, particularly helpful in places where cycling levels are currently low, but increases are planned or sought. Mapping risk will help authorities prioritise engineering changes and/or plan enforcement and/or educational initiatives, e.g. locations for \u2018close pass\u2019 initiatives or junction surveillance.",

                    "description": "Researching cycling safety and transport planning. \n\"Reducing Cycling Injuries while Cycling Grows \" the project is funded by the Road Safety Trust. This research project will use novel case\u2010crossover methods to compare route environment characteristics of sites where cyclists were injured with \u2018control\u2019 sites on their routes prior to injury. In this project, data concerning road safety are analyzed.  I model the routes that we think cyclists followed prior to an injury, based on home-work journeys. Doing this means we can compare places people were injured with the rest of their routes, and so see what types of location are most dangerous - rather than just identifying places where most injuries happen, which might just be due to having the most cyclists.\nBuilt environment characteristics as factors which influence injury risk are explored.",
