    "summary": "After I finished Gymnasium, I studied International Business Management at the HHS in The Hague and Psychology at the University of Amsterdam. During the latter I also studied Voice and Piano at the Conservatory of Alkmaar and afterwards Classical Voice at the Conservatory of Amsterdam and at the Accademia Nazionale di Belcanto in Italy.\nI have worked and lived abroad for several years: the USA, Spain, Puerto Rico and Italy.\n\nI have always loved studying and have been an active member of Mensa International for many years.\n\nAt the moment I am a fulltime vocalist, pianist and vocal & piano coach for professional and talented developing (adult) students in my sunny home in Amstelveen and through Zoom online all over the world. I performed in many countries and am proud to say for royalty guests such as Prince Albert of Monaco. I have recorded a duet with Andrea Bocelli, who I have met on several occasions. \n\nSpecializations: I am educated in both classical singing and pop/jazz/musical. Knowledge of belcanto, curbing and belting technique. My strength in piano lies in harmony, music theory and chords. I help many students of Conservatoria with their exams and auditions.\n\nHigh class performances for openings, gala's, high-profile events, et cetera. \n\nI am also a host for concerts, galas, academic, business and charity events. Presentations in Dutch-English-Spanish-Italian-French-German. \n\nMy interests are diverse as you can see. I have also worked as a model and love traveling and I am an ambassador for various charities. \n\nI created online courses in vocal development on www.mastertheartofsinging.com, and published several blogs and articles on the voice.
