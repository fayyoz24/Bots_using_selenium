I am responsible for multiple solutions concerning timely activation of assets through administrative adjustments, system integration and the facilitation of asset construction following Agile principles.\n\nFor my second project I got two assignments within the Technology business unit. Here I was asked to create a roadmap for provisioning tooling within the Technology B2B Services department, while also working on a financial network model for capacity planning within the IP & Transport department.\n\nFor my third, and final, trainee project I am asked to create performance management analyses for the different Real Estate asset classes present within the company.
