A team of 40 architects responsible for the KPN infrastructure. \nThe first architecture project was to define an architecture for KPN wide log management and security, capable of handling over one million events per second and storing these for half a year, without having a huge impact on resources. Based on developments in data analytics I have recommended a Hadoop platform for the long term datastore and forensics capability with a syslog based collection layer. This solution is also designed to replace individual log storage solutions, to ensure that the solution basically replaces the storage of data instead of adding extra storage.\nI also have been involved in the development of an Openstack solution where I had to ensure security and BCM requirements were taken into account for the architecture and design of that platform. This project was followed by a visionary project to optimise data collection, storage and processing for resource related data and telemetrics. So far every solution had their own data collection store and analytics capability and together with some architects from related departments we worked out an architecture which would fit KPN on the long term, using HDFS storage and streaming analytics capabilities.",

I wrote the policies on log management, system hardening, Bring your own device, Backup and Restore, Office Automation and System Security.\nIn order to verify correct implementation of the new KSP, I was assigned two big projects, the KPN E\u00e9n business proposition transition project and the Mobile Operations business support transition project. I managed to both verify a correct KSP implementation and effectiveness of our policies, and help the project with giving advice on how to improve security for their projects. I also am a core member of the Security Architecture Team, where difficult architecture cases were discussed and am also the editor of some chapters of the Security Architecture Guidelines and BCM Architecture Guidelines.\nDuring my time at the CISO Office, I have also been responsible for the functional management of the BCM disaster recovery plan repository.\nMy last assignment within the CISO was to participate in the simplify edition of the BCM polices. These policies were hardly changed in the first edition of the KSP and underwent a major rewrite. In this project I have given consultancy and participated in the pressure cooker workshops to write the policies and tools.",

Directly after the handover of the platform from a project to an operational organization, I got the role of Security Officer.\nMy first project has been the implementation of a Citrix Metaframe solution in order to have a protected access to the platform for the operations engineers.\nAlthough security has been defined as important, the necessity for speed during implementation caused some concerns with regard to continuity and reliability. Approximately half of 2006 has been used to keep security in line with growth and to apply short-term controls to prevent damage due to the quick growth (Within one year, the amount of customers went from 0 to 500000+ and there have been incidents with customers trying to steal passwords, phone numbers being mixed up etc.). This work involved fixing security issues within equipment like the Session Border Controllers, SIP-servers and the residential gateways, which are managed by a central device management server. I also have been involved in setting up this server to use the TR-069 protocol including the use of server-side certificates and have even helped to improve the TR-069 protocol with regard to NTP time dependencies.\nFor Lawful Interception, I wrote the procedures to comply with the LI-specific government requirements for the IPB service and these procedures were also used in other domains (Intenret and Mail).\nIn 2007 a project has been started to tackle a lot of problems caused by the rapid introduction of the service to our customers. I have been involved as a consultant and have helped to introduce long-term solutions and controls to reach a carrier grade quality and stability.\nI have also written operational requirement documents for user management, based on Radius, DMZ-usage, remote access security and Residential-gateway requirements.",
