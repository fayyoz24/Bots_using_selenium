    "summary": "In my work I seamlessly combine scientific research and new technologies to deliver an empowering experience that is accessible both intellectually and technologically.\n\nMy immersive art installations, often described as eco- or awareness art, turn the impact of climate change, air pollution, ocean plastic, diversity, data misuse into a tangible experience. Using a fluid mixture of data, nature, kinetic motion, water, digital visualisations, analog elements, the virtual and real worlds.\n\nCurrently I hold a teaching position at the Delft University of Technology (NL) and a Fellowship at the VU University and founded Woven studio to bridge the gap between science and culture.\n\nI have won awards like the prestigious Lumen prize for digital art, got nominated for the Stars Prize from Ars Electronica, and the New Technology Art Award and has exhibited at Fondation Cartier pour l\u2019art contemporain Paris (FR), Today Art Museum (CN), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (NL), Science Gallery Dublin (IE), SXSW (USA), Science Centre Kuwait (KW), MU Gallery (NL) and have been featured in Wired, New Scientist, Financial Times and Discovery Channel.",

In my work I use the latest technologies to turn visitors into ocean plastic, give a voice to nature using data coming from living trees or let a physical digital rainforest disappear in front of your eyes.\n\nIn my work I was lucky to work with the best scientists from ESA to Unesco,  from the Florance university to the Natural History Museum.  My work has been widely awarded. It has won the prestigious Lumen Prize for digital art, is nominated for the Stars Prize from Ars Electronica and the New Technology Art Award. He has exhibited at Fondation Cartier pour l\u2019art contemporain Paris (FR), Today Art Museum (CN), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (NL), Science Gallery Dublin (IE), SXSW (USA), Science Centre Kuwait (KW), Mu Gallery (NL) and has been featured in Wired, New Scientist, Financial Times and Discovery Channel and even the Donald Duck.",
