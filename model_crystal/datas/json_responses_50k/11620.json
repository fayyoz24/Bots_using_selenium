    "summary": "After high school I have studied HTS Chemistry (Bachelor degree) in Eindhoven. Then I have worked at Philips and at NXP Semiconductors (when it was seperated from Philips). I have a broad high tech experience in (semiconductor) technology, from research, development and the last years in manufacturing. \nI have a practical, hands-on mentality, and I like contact with people on the work/shop floor. As a certified green belt I have experience with SPC, 6 sigma, 8D problem solving, and implementing continuous quality improvement projects.\nSome of my personal qualities are that I am honest, hard working, accurate, systematic, patient, persistent, eager to learn.\n\nMy hobbies are spending quality time with my family (wife and two children), video filming, tennis, PC, reading, ...",

            "description": "A method of manufacturing an optoelectronic semiconductor device includes the step of providing two comparatively thin layers next to one another on a substrate by means of a non-selective growing process, an etching process, and a selective growing process, a cladding layer being present over said thin layers. In the known method, first the one thin layer and the cladding layer are grown, the latter is locally removed, and the other thin layer and the cladding layer are then grown in that position. This method has the disadvantage that unevennesses (steps or openings) often arise at the surface of the layer structure above the transition between the thin layers. In the present method, in a first non-selective growing process the one layer and a small portion of the cladding layer are provided, these layers are locally removed in the etching process, and the other thin layer and a small portion of the cladding layer are provided in that location in the selective growing process, after which in a second non-selective growing process the major portion of the cladding layer is provided. The layer structure obtained has a substantially plane surface which is free from defects and is very suitable for further processing. The thin layers may be, inter alia, an active and a radiation-guiding layer. In particular, devices having a mesa structure can be manufactured with a high accuracy and yield.\r\nlink: http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=11&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=5,472,907&OS=5,472,907&RS=5,472,907",
