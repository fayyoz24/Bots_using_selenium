    "summary": "I love selling brands, but I don\u2019t really like selling myself ;) So here are a few facts about me and why I love what I'm learning.\n\nDuring high school, I developed an interest in advertisements and commercials. Especially the commercials around Christmas that always manage to make me emotional. As soon as I started my study Marketing Management, I found that there are a lot more aspects about branding that I absolutely love. From learning about interacting with people from different backgrounds, to precisely elaborating a detailed export plan or business plan. Currently,  I'm following a premaster as minor, which is a special collaboration between The Erasmus University and The Hague University. I completed the first semester of this minor without any retakes.",

The Girls Empowerment Foundation is a charity that provided a group of orphaned girls with education and a safe place where they can shelter, get healthy food, and where they will always be welcomed with love. \nWhen I was in Kenya a new school was opened, named Henny's Academy. We as volunteers were mainly involved with the opening party of the school. We also spent a lot of time with the girls at their newly built home. Close relationships were formed very quickly. Ever since I've been to Kenya, I feel very committed to this charity and keep in touch with the founders almost every month.\n"
