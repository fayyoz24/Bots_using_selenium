The flow was adjusted to get multiple Reynolds number and the distance between the cylinders were changed to get results for flow around multiple cylinders at different Reynolds number. These flows were video recorded and the results compared to numerical simulations found in various literature. However it was soon realized that this work can be further enhanced by using a Particle Image Velocimetry technique on a single cylinder. Thus to take it to the next level a Particle image Velocimetry setup was installed in the college on the same setup used for the flow visualization around multiple cylinders. The project work gives an insight into the flow around multiple in-line and side by side cylinders and Von Karman Vortex formation behind a single cylinder at low Reynolds number using the Particle Image Velocimetry technique. Valuable knowledge was gained on how flow visualization is done, how the PIV setup works, its advantages over other experimental techniques, and the difficulties of experimental work.",
