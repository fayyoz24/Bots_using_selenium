    "summary": "I am an Assistant Professor (with tenure) in Breakthrough Technologies, Management and Policy and an Associate Lead of the Breakthrough Technology Innovation Group. With 10 years of research experience I have a deep understanding of how emerging and disruptive technologies can be leveraged to create sustainable solutions for the world's most pressing problems in i.e. healthcare, energy systems, city development, agriculture and food systems, and higher education. \nMy work has focused on the nature and nurture side of breakthrough technology, looking into the techno-economic viability for its implementation and considering organizational and individual aspects in fostering deep tech ventures in the process. Besides, I also have a proven track record of developing innovative solutions that have real-world impact. I have published in several respected journals on the topic such as Technology Forecasting and Social Change, Renewable Energy, Studies in Higher Education, Higher Education Policy, among others. \n\nWorking on a better world\nI have worked with a variety of organizations, from startups (e.g. Fitsurance, Preactive) to universities and governments (e.g. Portugal) to help them identify and capitalize on new opportunities in the technology and sustainability sectors. Currently, I am the scientific coordinator of the Knowledge for People, the Planet and Prosperity through Partnerships which promotes collaborative projects fostering Human Agency and the governance of data ecologies to achieve Sustainable and Healthy Territories and reduce inequalities in the digital age, together with \u201cNet Zero\u201d societies https://k4palliances.com.\n\nEducation and international collaboration\nI hold a double PhD degree from ISCTE, the Open University in Lisbon and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and continue to push the boundaries of breakthrough and deep tech research through ongoing collaboration with colleagues in academia and industry. Among others, my international collaborations extend to universities in Germany (Munster University of Applied Sciences), Portugal (University of Lisbon; Aveiro University), US (MIT Media Lab), Japan (Waseda and Sophia University) and Sweden.",

While most higher education scholars have associated university change and transformations to global trends pointing to convergence, higher education systems and individual universities receive the same inputs very differently, leading to dissimilar interpretations at national level and implementation at university level. We perform a qualitative comparative documental analysis of the national Laws and the statutes of all the 94 state universities across Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands. Contrary to previous comparative studies in policy translation which interpreted national university governance reforms as deviations from an ideologically dominant global policy, and analysed institutional outcomes by focusing just on few institutional case studies, we focus on both national reform specificities and their translation at institutional levels covering three whole state university system. Our preliminary findings highlight not only divergences in policy translation across higher education systems, but also variations in the translation of unitary national Laws by universities within the same country.",
