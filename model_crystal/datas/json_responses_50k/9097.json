I was also responsible for the financial success of the event, since it was partially dependant on the sales.\n\nIn March, we were faced with a tough situation of having to postpone Fanfara due to COVID-19 and transform it online. We successfully adapted marketing activities, redesigned the visuals and helped other teams with the transition.\n\nWe surpassed the initial goal and attracted more than 370 attendees and 12 excellent speakers, ending the event with excellent reviews.",
