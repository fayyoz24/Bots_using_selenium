                    "description": "As a relationship manager (revenues > EUR 250mln) in the Benelux offshore and maritime sector (e.g. Boskalis, Van Oord, Heerema Marine Contractors, DEME, Jan De Nul, Fugro), I was responsible for managing a c. Eur 3bln loan portfolio and increasing strategic income on these clients. During my time, the portfolio almost doubled through expansion on existing clients and targeting new clients. I managed structuring of large financial investments and restructurings. I advised on a wide range of strategic challenges as well as solving day to day operational issues. I really loved managing this long term, extremely important client base for the bank. It is very exciting to aid these seasoned entrepreneurs with experiences from banking, innovation and digital transformation perspective.",
