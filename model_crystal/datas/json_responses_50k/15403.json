    "summary": "Building is what I do best and get energized by. Whether it is building relationships and trust and consequently deals, innovative ideas and products, or alignment and enthusiasm among colleagues. \nI am an authentic entrepreneurial spirit, a quick thinker and a bin full of ideas who excels in identifying opportunities within a complex international environment. Opportunities that I orchestrate in a multiple stake holder environment and bring to the finish line with a can-do-mentality as part of a long-term vision and strategy.  My ability to quickly comprehend complex matter, and make it understandable and insightful for a broader audience has contributed to my successes.\n\nFurthermore my strengths lie in inspiring and enthusing teams and people, challenging sticky patterns and coming up with practical and workable alternatives with an interest in people and their needs. The challenges of life have triggered me to re-invent myself on several occasions over recent years, to come out as a more complete and mature person. \n\nI perform best in a professional international, dynamic and innovative environment with room for unconventional ideas and change. Currently as a co-founder and venture lead for my own corporate start-up Payday, wich we are currently running through the prove scales phase of the ABN AMRO innovation funnel. \n\nPersonal Style & Competencies:\n\nUnconventional, energetic, relationship builder, team-builder, go-getter,  perseverance, always be closing, entrepreneurial, intelligent",
