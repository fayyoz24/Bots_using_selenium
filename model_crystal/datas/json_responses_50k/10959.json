To keep the panel cool heat exchangers can be attached below the PV panel. \n\nUsing COMSOL, simulations of different scenarios was done  for Air, Water and Freon as the flowing fluid. The effects for changing channel dimensions, changing velocities of the fluid flows and usage of different insulators was also investigated.\n\nAfter simulations water turns out to be the best solution for a faster heat transfer. However, having a continuous flowing water channel can be much more expensive than using an air channel.\n\nAn economic study for the same can prove to be vital in knowing which channel is cost-effective as per the required power output.",

The ones chosen for the calculations are Current, Voltage, Solar Irradiation and Temperature of the Electrolyser.\n\nAfter the data had been collected, the sensitivity for the production rate of hydrogen had been calculated with the help of a mathematical method, known as 'Taguchi's Method'. \n\nThe results showed that production rate was most affected by Current flowing through the electrolyser.\n",
