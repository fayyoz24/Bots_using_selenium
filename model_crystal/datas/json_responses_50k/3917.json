    "summary": "I am a captivating East African social entrepreneur [currently based in The Netherlands], curator, and collaborator of innovative solutions for opportunity collaboration, youth employability, challenge-driven education, start-up vision planning, community organizing, resource mobilization, research, social impact, leadership gaps, entrepreneurial competencies, child rights, and public policy reforms. \n\nCurrently, I am teaching at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University in the Responsible Business Leadership course. This position is a perfect intersection of my educational interests and my professional experience making a perfect harmony in social entrepreneurship. We explore themes in global sustainability, personal responsibility, leadership  and ethics in business.\n\nI have close to a decade of working experience with governmental, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions on different development and humanitarian themes. I.e. resource mobilization, philanthropy, child protection, sustainability, HIV and AIDS programs, donor & and investor relations, youth empowerment, advocacy campaign management, capacity building, reproductive health and rights, gender-based violence (GBV), decent work, and economic development. \n\nAs a local economic development specialist, I hold the belief that the crisis of global problems can be answered through \"global exchange for local change.\" Further to this, I research fiscal decentralization, child poverty, public-private partnerships, and social value chains.\n\nI enjoy working with communities empowering them for positive change by employing modern tools in facilitation and ICT seasoned with some humor. My future plan is to work with multiple stakeholders to address poverty and injustice through policy cohesion, research, and entrepreneurial competencies.\n\nMy professional strengths revolve around training and facilitation, research, advocacy, project proposal writing, oration, blogging, event organizing and coordination, business development, donor and partner engagement, process improvement, copy editing, administration, public relations, research, children and youth programs, recruitment and fundraising.\n\nAway from my listed professional life, during my free time, I turn my passion to profit under my registered sole proprietorship, Krown Services in Beauty, Personal, and care work.\nI also invest my time in mentorship and select community volunteer activities.",
