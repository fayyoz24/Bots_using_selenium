During the think tank \"Health in space\", we conducted research on the applicability of social robots during spaceflights and on the earth, as our client was the REshape Innovation Center of Radboud University Medical Center. \n\nA lot of the challenges the space community face are similar to the ones we see solutions for in the healthcare innovation domain, be it in design or technology. What will medical autonomy look like on our way to Mars and what will be the first applications of this philosophy on Earth? We dealt with these issues and we designed a possible solution related to our research outcome. The proposed solution focuses on an innovative tool for the managing of interpersonal conflicts that are caused by psychological characteristics. It is a smartwatch which collect data such as vitals from each user and give recommendation like a personal coach, who advise you how you can manage upcoming interpersonal conflicts.\n\nSkills\nThis programme focuses on the skill of working with others. Besides conducting a research as a group, I realized my role in the team. Furthermore, I followed several training sessions for project management, English Academic Writing and presenting.",
