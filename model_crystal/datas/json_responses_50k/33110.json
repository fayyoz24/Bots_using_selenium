    "summary": "I believe in the power of people, creativity, and collaboration; the ability to achieve amazing things when people connect! \nUnfortunately, too often these powers are diminished or blocked by outdated corporate structures and cultures. \n\nAs Agile coach and licensed Management 3.0 facilitator I apply my passion to support people, teams, and organisations to transform the way they organise and manage work.\nCreating cultures, structures and (ideally lean) processes that support engaged employees to create valuable experiences for companies, customers, and society.\n\nUsing a human and customer centric approach, putting mindset before methodologies.\nFirst, I need to understand the challenge or opportunity we\u2019re tackling to agnostically apply my skills and expertise.\n\nFrom a transformation perspective I have experience with IT, marketing, HR and enterprise-wide change initiatives using methodologies such as Scrum, Design Thinking, SAFE, Customer Experience, A/B testing and Management 3.0.\n \nPrior to my role as Agile coach, I spent 20 years in B2B commercial and advisory roles, learning how important it is to understand the WHY behind each question to create customer specific solutions. \nAnd gathered first-hand experience of the positive and negative influence that management and leadership have on organisational & people performance and motivation.\n\nCompetencies:\nManage / coach / train employees and teams in management, business and technology.\nPublic speaking, storytelling, deliver fact based insights & advice\nManage & grow partner based business relationship\nUnderstand and address strategic customer needs in multiple disciplines\nBuilding strong teams and connecting people.\n\nInterests: personal development, coach / train / manage, explore new companies & cultures, international & dynamic working environment, challenging goals, create a customer obsessed culture, drive cooperation across corporate silo\u2019s, driving change, reshaping the world of work.",
