    "summary": "Materials scientist with strong analytical and communication skills. Starting out as chemistry student, I have gradually specialized myself in the surface and bulk properties of the solid state. Currently, I am working as a process and materials analyst in the semiconductor industry.\n\nI love investigating complex problems that require a broad view and multidisciplinary approach. My ambition is to provide customers with timely solutions while delivering innovative output of the highest quality. Involved in research projects as well as in production issues.\n\nI consider myself as a team player in the first place. On the other hand, I have proven to be a succesfull autonomous researcher as well. Friendly but determined. No-nonsense attitude; wants to get the job done.\n\nSpecialties: - Silicon (substrates / wafers, thin films, crystal defects, etching)\n- IC process technology, especially front-end issues. Also interested in solar cell technology\n- Thin film deposition (epitaxy, CVD, ALD)\n- Crystal growth\n- Surface and bulk analysis techniques. Hands-on experience with numerous methods, including SEM, TEM, EDX, EELS, FIB, SIMS, XRD, XPS, AES, RBS, AFM, \u00b5-PCD, SIRD and wet-chemical etching\n- Coaching. I enjoy teaching process courses or giving tool training to colleagues\n\nPMI-certified Project Management Professional (PMP)\nITC-certified Infrared Thermographer Level 2",

                    "description": "This introduction into the world of IC technology marked my switch from fundamental to applied research.\n\nAs post-doc at DIMES, I successfully built and employed a setup to study the excimer-laser annealing of amorphous silicon films on glass wafers. The melting and recrystallization models I obtained supported my group in processing arrays of single-crystalline silicon islands on amorphous carriers. Ultimately, the ability to create such arrays allows for the processing of thin-film transistors with far superior performance for, e.g., active-matrix displays.\n\nFour publications with over 40 citations.",
