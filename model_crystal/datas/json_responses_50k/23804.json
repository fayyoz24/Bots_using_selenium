FLEX was created from the belief of former Senator Bill Bradley that the best way to ensure long-lasting peace and mutual understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia is to enable young people to learn about the U.S. and Americans firsthand, and to teach Americans about their countries.\n \nFLEX is a highly competitive, merit-based scholarship program funded by the U.S. Department of State that operates in Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Over 35,000 students compete annually in multiple rounds of testing to earn a FLEX scholarship, which provides for them to spend an academic year in the United States living with a volunteer host family and attending a U.S. high school.\n\u200b\nWhile in the U.S., FLEX students gain leadership skills, learn about American society and values, and teach Americans about their home countries and cultures. FLEX students perform community service in their U.S. communities and act as ambassadors of their home countries. Many are inspired by this spirit of volunteerism to develop and implement innovative projects in their home countries, using the skills and ideas they gained while on program. FLEX students are naturally curious and enthusiastic citizens of the world.",

We were particularly interested in learning what had become of the locals who were children at the time of the Chernobyl accident that took place over 30 years ago.\n\nWe began by visiting a city called Zhytomyr, located approximately 130 kilometres west of Kiev. Arriving at a pediatric hospital, we were surprised by the number of children hospitalized with various diseases and disabilities. Although the city was located over a hundred kilometres away from the place of the accident and the children themselves hadn\u2019t directly experienced the disaster, many still suffered the effects of the radioactive substances ingested by their parents. We were reminded that the Chernobyl accident was not in the past\u2014to the people of Ukraine, it was an ongoing problem that still required a solution. Coming from a country with a shared experience of nuclear disaster, we felt that it was impossible to turn a blind eye to the situation.\n\nThrough our activities in Ukraine, we hope to share how the Chernobyl accident continues to impact the country.\n\nWe continue to conduct yearly on-site investigations, provide support towards facilities and engage the local children in cultural exchange programs.\n\nFrom 2017 onward, we have engaged in an annual project known as the \u201cUkraine & Fukushima Children\u2019s Exchange Program\u201d.\n\nEach year, we invite several Ukrainian children to Fukushima Prefecture, where the children are able to learn about Fukushima\u2019s nuclear disaster, experience Japanese culture through activities such as tea ceremonies, and interact with the local people through school visits and homestays.\n\nWe also exchange Christmas cards and letters between Ukraine, Fukushima, and Nepal, in order to promote cross-cultural communication.",
