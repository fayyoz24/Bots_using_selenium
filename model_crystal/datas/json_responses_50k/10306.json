    "summary": "I am a Test Development Engineer with more than 20 years\u2019 experience in the high-tech electronics and semiconductor industry. Especially experienced in test development with specialization in integrated circuits of Mixed Signal, Automotive Networking and Automotive Led Drivers. \n\nAs a test development engineer I prefer both defining test hardware and developing test software on (semi-) Automated Test Equipment (ATE). Finding best and most simple solution as possible is one of my personal skills. Hence simple solutions can easily be used and transferred to other colleagues. Working together with multi-disciplinary project teams achieving project milestones is another personal skill. I am enthusiastic working with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) based test methods, Design-for-Testability (DfT) techniques and very interested in RF testing techniques.\n\nI am an easy going, accurate, self starting, problem solving attitude, driven, out of the box thinking person with a sense of humor. I like to work in an ambitious and result driven working environment in which personal development is stimulated. I am eager to develop both my test development skills and knowledge and like to work together with multi-disciplinary teams.\n\nKnowledge of Unix, Linux, Pascal, C, C++, data analysis (DataPower), RF, ADC, IFAD, digital circuits, PLL, MTP (Multiple Time Programmable non-volatile memory), LabVIEW, Minitab and SVN versioning software. \n\nExperienced on ATE platforms Teradyne A575, Agilent 93k, SPEA 372MX and knowledge of LTX-C.",
