    "summary": "I am an aspiring scientist in Animal Agriculture and Genetics and MSc student at Wageningen University's Animal Sciences programme with a BSc in Animal Science from University of California, Davis. Starting my career with a love of animals, I developed a fascination for the role science plays in improving people's lives. I hope to contribute to improving global food security and agricultural sustainability through scientific research and education. My goal is to combine my skills and knowledge in the fields of Animal Agriculture and Biotechnology in order to contribute where I can to improving the quality of life for underprivileged people, global food security, agricultural sustainability, and animal welfare. \n\nHaving lived in China, Hong Kong, the United States, and now the Netherlands, and pursued education alongside people from all over the world, I approach the world from the perspective of a global citizen. My passion for improving food security and agricultural sustainability both applies to my local community and extends internationally. I am continuously attempting to learn more about different cultural and professional practices in my fields of interest and I am hopeful that my experiences with people around the world brings a new perspective to the table. \n\nI have experience working in molecular neurobiology and marine water quality research as well as practical experience in equine husbandry. I am trained in molecular biology laboratory techniques and familiar with methods in genetic research. \n\nCurrently, I also hope to better my skills in programming and learning Dutch. In my free time, I enjoy the visual and musical arts, horseback riding, caring for aquariums and house plants, and spending time with my pets. \n\nI can be reached here at LinkedIn and at scarlet.sung@wur.nl\nAKA: Tsz Ching Sung, Sung Tsz Ching, \u5b8b\u5b50\u6674",
