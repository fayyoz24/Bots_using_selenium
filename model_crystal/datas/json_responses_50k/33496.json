Cordaid thereby fights poverty in the Netherlands and seeks to increase the (social) participation of these people in the Dutch society and economy.\n\n- I organized and coordinated a national debate among aldermen to involve various actors in the development of the program and to achieve broader societal support \n- I represented the NGO at conferences and worked on capacity building with local governments and civil society organizations\n- I presented the program among people with social benefits and gave a master class to high-school students on poverty in the Netherlands\n- I evaluated and reported on the performance and impact of the program through various communication materials and contributed to program administration",
