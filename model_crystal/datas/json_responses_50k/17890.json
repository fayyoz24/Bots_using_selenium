    "summary": "I am a second-generation Kenyan from Las Vegas (USA). As a passionate social science graduate, I'm interested in championing social and racial justice and getting others fired up to create change wherever they are. I combine my interests in local and global movements with my love for communicating, design and research. \n\nWhat makes me tick? I enjoy being hands-on with each project, from filming and writing to editing and crafting visuals that are on-brand and in tune with crucial issues. Beyond anything, my goal is to lend my skills in storytelling to assist in community-level initiatives raising awareness on social (in)equities.\n\n\u2727 Get to know me:\n\u2709 Visit my website at https://sarahnjoroge.com\n\u2709 Send me a direct message or contact me via email at andforsarah@gmail.com",
