    "summary": "I am a highly motivated, energetic, outgoing positive person who is always looking to push myself to improve not only myself but the people around me.  My mental strength is one of my keys to success as well as my positive outlook on life.  Im very much a people manager, I enjoy working with people from different backgrounds and i believe I can get the best out of people in all situations.\n\nI grew up in England and at a young age I was helping at my parents business in the school holidays to keep myself busy and this set me up for the way I work.  I was always heavily into sports, mainly football and running and after a couple of bad injuries i never let my confidence drop and i continued to push myself.\n\nI left school and got into catering, starting with a trainee manager course at a hotel, lots of unsociable hours but lots of opportunities to learn and grow.  I was studying while working which took up a lot of time but i knew it would help me in the future.  I spent a summer in Greece and went back to England and began to work at a football club, a job which i loved but I realised that I needed a new challenge so I moved out to Holland and began my new life both personally and professionally.  \n\nI fell in love with logistics and operational management working with many different people, customers and suppliers.
