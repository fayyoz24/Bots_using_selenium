    "summary": "I am a PhD researcher of real estate management and circular built environment at TU Delft. Currently I am working in incorporating the principles of circular built environment and sustainable building adaptation into an integrated framework, in order to enable the building industry and the property market to meet future demand in light of the economic and environmental changes.\n\nDuring my master\u2019s study, I conducted several studies on investigating the practical techniques for improving the AEC/FM performance in adaptive reuse projects. I also worked during my bachelor's study in designing and  developing technical documents for different types of building, using  state-of-the-art tools and technologies.  \n\n",
