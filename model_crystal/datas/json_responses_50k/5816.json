Together, we've run numerous conferences and hackathons in Poland as well as abroad. \n\nTogether, we've created HackYeah - the biggest stationary hackathon in Europe and one of the biggest in the world (www.hackyeah.pl). With this project we're redefining the idea of a hackathon to make it a festival-like event. Building this event from an idea in our heads to over 2500 attendees and almost half milion PLN in prizes, we're continuing our work to make it a unique and unforgettable experience for everyone. \n\nWe're also working on expanding projects that have a history. We adopted CONFidence Conference, the oldest Polish Infosec conference, and amplified the number of attendees by 100% whilst boosting their satisfaction level. Currently, we're working on making CONFidence a recognizable brand outside of Poland with the goal of gaining international recognition. \n\nMy role as a Team Leader focuses on creating the vision of an event, setting team goals, budgeting, delegating tasks, monitoring performance, as well as motivating and crafting space for team members to grow.",
