It was observed that when B. subtilis cells undergo an osmotic shock, they can acquire resistance to some antibiotics, such as kanamycin, up to 5 times the MIC. The processes underlying osmotic adaptation are still not fully uncovered, thus an exploratory analysis with a transcriptomic approach (RNA-Seq) was taken. \nIn this project, I analyzed the gene expression dataset using the webserver T-REx for statistical assessment. The analysis included Pearson\u2019s correlation matrices, Principal Component Analysis, interpretation of MA and volcano plots, contrasts among groups. At the same time, functional analysis was performed using the webserver GSEA-pro v2.",

Generally, they are associated to NADP+ as cofactor. However, methanogens can sometimes present an alternative enzyme which is bound to a 5\u2019-deazaflavin cofactor termed F420. This difference provides the thermostable F420-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from M. thermophilicus (ADF) with peculiar features that make it appealing for industrial applications. Nevertheless, ADF shows two major issues: inclusion bodies formation and loss of activity upon freezing. Both these issues were tackled throughout my project. As for the former, the heterologous expression conditions were fine-tuned (temperature, host strain, expression time, purification tags) reaching slightly improved yields. On the other hand, freezing sensitivity was firstly tackled with side-directed mutagenesis, then with the exploration of co-solvents with known beneficial effects on protein stability. Lastly, an extensive literature research coupled with a precise ADF-identification pipeline and in-silico prediction of the 3D folding identified four potential homologous enzymes.",
