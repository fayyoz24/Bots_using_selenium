The project uses the Microsoft Hololens 2 which encourages the pati\u00ebnt to exercise in a fun and safe environment. In the game the player use their hands to break streams of crystals in tune with the music that seemingly appears from a portal to another world. Our goal for the project was to develop a challenging yet simple game that takes into account the energy levels of the patients and to make them forget about their illness. We put a heavy focus on Tai Chi inspired movements that give the player a sense of Freedom, Relaxation and Empowerment.\n\nFor more information about rehabilitation games check out: https://holomoves.nl/en/",
