In Thailand, my main activities were giving community and school education. I also assisted at homecare and children\u00b4s camp. After we came back, we raised public awareness for this subject by the organisation of Thai dinners and Thai cooking classes with an educational character. Also, we gave several presentations about our project and Siam-Care at schools, companies, stores and other places.\n"
