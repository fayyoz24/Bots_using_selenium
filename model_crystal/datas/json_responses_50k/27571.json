Our focus was on fostering environments that did not perpetuate any form of oppression among diverse groups and individuals. Through engaging conversations, we explored topics such as feminism, anti-racism, anti-homophobia, the challenges faced by frontline communities, intersectionality, and more. By actively participating in these discussions, I contributed to the collective effort of creating a more inclusive and just society."
