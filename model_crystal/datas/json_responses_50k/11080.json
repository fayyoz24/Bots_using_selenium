    "summary": "When developing a new treatment, we always talk ABOUT patients. But we should be talking TO them more often, en really LISTEN, to understand what would bring value to their lives and how a new treatment could address their unmet needs.\n\nIn my current role as Health Value Translation Lead at Sanofi, I am responsible to ensure the Patient Voice is taken into account throughout development of a new asset. As part of the Patient Informed Development & Health Value Translation team, I work closely together with Patient Engagement Leads and Clinical Outcome Assessment scientist, to bring the patient-informed science to the global project teams. My focus is in the oncology area, working on both hematological and well as solid organ malignancies. The aim is to differentiate our products from current and future treatments to help build the value dossier from a patient perspective. This requires a thorough understanding of patient needs and preferences and in-depth evaluation of patient\u2019s perception of the new treatment. Furthermore, we deep-dive into the heterogeneity of the target patient population to help inform the Diversity & Inclusion strategy for clinical trials. \n\nI studied pharmacy at the University of Ghent, Belgium, followed by a PhD in Advanced Drug Delivery at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. As Head of PMO at Kiadis Pharma I was responsible to set-up a project-centric way of working and establish effective governance and decision-making processes. Upon the acquisition by Sanofi, I had the opportunity to help manage the integration of people, projects and processes. Before joining Kiadis/Sanofi, I was part of the Corporate Scientific Department of Nordic Pharma, responsible for Product Development and Project Management. I started my career in the industry as a Scientist in Early Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nMy background in pharmacy and the roles I had till date allow me to both dive into the science when needed, as well as to oversee the full development trajectory of any type of drug product.\n\nDynamic, confident and passionate is how I would describe my personality. I enjoy working at a strategic level, in a multi-disciplinary and international environment. My strong points are my natural leadership and my ability to zoom out and present complex matter at a high level. In my job, I thrive when I feel that I am making the difference, when my actions have impact. I am mostly appreciated for my enthusiasm, open and result-driven attitude, excellent communication skills, eagerness to learn and my personal drive.",

For a large number of projects the pharmaceutical development was performed at Indeus, a sister-company of Disphar, located in Mumbai. I frequently traveled to Mumbai for more in-dept discussions on the projects. I regarded working with third parties, in international teams, in which cultural differences can be immense, as the most challenging and rewarding part of the job. \nIn addition to the content discussions and overall management of the projects, I enjoyed presenting to higher management.

Every NCE generates new challenges and requires a suitable development approach to be puzzled out. The activities of a Pharmaceutical Scientist therefore included the setup of a strategy, practical development of formulations and writing of protocols, reports and source documents for regulatory purposes.  Successful development of an NCE is strongly dependent on close collaboration between all disciplines involved, i.e. pharmacy, chemistry, analytics, toxicology, clinical pharmacology, etc. Regularly, I was involved in interdisciplinary meetings to update the team on the progress of the project. I consulted experts on a day-to-day basis, both within the company as outside, e.g. in the academic world. \nWithin the pharmaceutical platform, I was contact person for internships and organized so-called \u2018nose around\u2019 internships during which students could get acquainted with different roles pharmacists can play in the development of a new drug, from discovery up to market launch.",
