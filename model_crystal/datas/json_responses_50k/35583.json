    "summary": "Passionate about culture, education, and sustainable development, I am looking for a full-time job in Paris, France.\n\nI see myself working as an International Project Officer / International Relations Officer / Communications Officer in the following structures: international organisations, cultural institutions, and universities.\n\nThe experience of studying in different countries has given me a sense of curiosity and willingness to engage in the resolution of various global issues. In addition to my university experience, I completed two internships at the UN specialised agencies UNICEF and UNESCO. Thanks to this great opportunity to be fully engaged in various organisational projects, I was able to develop a number of valuable work skills and learn from high-level professionals who inspired me by their work.\n\nCurrently, I have over 7 years of language teaching experience. I sincerely put all my heart into my work and love seeing my students' progress. Being bilingual in Russian and Lithuanian from an early age, I always loved learning languages. Besides my native languages, I am fluent in English, French, and Italian. In addition, I am currently learning Spanish and Dutch.\n\nThe experience and the knowledge that I have acquired formed my personality and my deep interest in culture, education, and sustainable development. I would describe myself as a detail-oriented person who is always ready to achieve personal and professional goals.",
