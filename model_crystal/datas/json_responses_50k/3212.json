    "summary": "I am a PhD candidate at Wageningen University working on developing digital twins for biodiversity monitoring within the Horizon Europe Nature FIRST project. My work will focus on four sites in Bulgaria, Spain, Romania and Ukraine which are all areas of high biodiversity.\n\nMy Biological Sciences MSc (by research) was undertaken at the University of Salford as part of the Molecular Ecology Group. My research project was on detecting amphibian communities at risk of Bsal infection in the Netherlands using eDNA metabarcoding, for which a paper is being prepared for publishing. I am also a first class graduate from the University of Leeds with a Geography BSc and specialisms in Ecology. My dissertation on native and invasive gecko species on Utila Island, Honduras earned me the Alison Parfitt prize for the most meritorious dissertation on a conservation theme.\n\nI have extensive experience with herpetofauna, having worked in an exotic animal rescue centre, reptile events company and for the Manchester Museum Vivarium.\nIn 2019, I spent 6 weeks on Utila Island, Honduras to conduct research on invasive geckos for my dissertation. In 2017, I spent a month in Madagascar conducting field research on the herpetofauna of Nosy Komba. I also have field experience in India, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK. All these experiences have fuelled my passion for ecology, herpetology and fieldwork.",
