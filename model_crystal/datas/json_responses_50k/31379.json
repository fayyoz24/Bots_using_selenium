Speakers  and subjects included: \n\nVesna Terselic, Anti-War Campaign of Croatia, showed how actions of local NGOs influenced public opinion in Croatia sufficiently to make the prosecution of Croat war crimes against Serbs acceptable\n\nZarko Puhovski, Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights \u201cA Friendly Critique of the ICTY\u201d\n\nNatasa Kandic, Humanitarian Law Centre Belgrade \u201cThe ICTY and local NGOs \u2013 Cooperation for Reconciliation\u201d\n\nMarijana Senjak, Medica Zenica (Multi-Ethnic Therapy Centre for Women), Bosnia-Herzegovina,  \u201cVictims and Witnesses \u2013 Their Role, Their Needs and Problems They Face\u201d\n\nNenad Fiser, ICTY Leadership Research Team \u201cMonitoring as the Essential Requirement for Lasting Peace\u201d \n\nLazar Stojanovic, filmmaker, OSCE \u2013 \u201cMyths as Used to Justify Violence\u201d\n\nMy contribution: idea, organising support for the concept within ICTY, consulting NGOs and human rights activists about the programme, obtaining permissions, organisational work. I would like to think that the first \"Beyond ICTY\" series made a contribution, however tiny, to a more integrative view on former Yugoslavia and raised awareness of the early local peace-building efforts.\n\nDue to its success, a second series followed, this time with former Yugoslav and international speakers. Several screenings of documentary films, followed by discussions, were also organised, including: \"Pine and fir trees\" , a production of Zagreb Centre for Women Studies.\n\n",
