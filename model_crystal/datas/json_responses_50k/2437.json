This domain accounts for approximately half (60 million) of total municipal spending.\n\nThe skills I particularly picked up and/or honed during this internship are:\n- Critical thinking\n- Finding integrative solutions\n- Conducting a structured literature review\n- Conducting structured interviews\n- Time management\n- Communication",
