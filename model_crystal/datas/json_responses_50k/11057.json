With that the Lead Engineer can focus more on their technical part and the Team Lead being the organizer, coach, planner, etc.\nBy dividing former Project Lead tasks over the newly created functions. we assure shorter lines with our customer, create more time for improving our group members.\nIt also gives a change to improve our WoW, introduce platforms for own employees to work on their own initiatives and therewith improve their own value/skills and our value for the customer.\nWith these changes we are sure we are better prepared for the future and to be more successful together.",
