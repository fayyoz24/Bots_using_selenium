The research identified 11 selection criteria which were carefully combined using expert knowledge. Results showed the top 10 location in the case study city of Amsterdam. \n\nKey challenges included; learning how to effectively use the software QGIS, gathering realistic and accurate geographic data, and developing selection criteria for an innovative new field. In the end, the tool selected fast-charging locations that are inline with the Fastned vision.",

Clients I supported invested $2.25 million in their homes and local communities, and were rewarded with $250,000 in rebates and incentives. \n\nExcellent customer service was the top priority at Populus which was reflected in the success of the start-up. Apart from solidifying my understanding on building science, I was able to strengthen my ability to build a professional and meaningful relationship with clients.",
