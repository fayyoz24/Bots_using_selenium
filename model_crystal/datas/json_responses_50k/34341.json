    "summary": "Growing up in Numan \u2013 a town by the river Gongola, in North-eastern Nigeria, has given me firsthand experience on flooding, health dangers from water pollution, water conflict, forced migration, and trivialized girl-child education. This instilled in me passion for education, and desire to contribute to solving water management challenges. My interest in addressing the gaps in water policy implementation, and failure to adopt climate adaptation strategies in water management practices has been my motivation.\n\nOver the past 8 years, I have acquired education in the field of hydrology, groundwater, global and climate change through international scholarships; hence leveraging my intellectual prowess, proven record of academic excellence, leadership skills, and passion for sustainable development. \n\nI have an understanding of the water nexus and the interdisciplinary dimensions of sustainable water management. Through internships in organisations such as the International Groundwater Assessment Centre (IGRAC), I have developed skills in research and consultancy which are important for conceptualizing and solving water problems. As an advocate, I believe that research is the foundation for successful advocacy.\n\nI look forward to offering my expertise in solving water-related problems.\n\nI enjoy meeting new people, hearing new perspectives, learning about different cultures, and trying new cooking recipes.",
