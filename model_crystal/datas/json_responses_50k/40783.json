In this project, you commit yourself to 80 hours, divided over a digital start, the Impact Bivouac, the Social Mission, and the reunion. 'MDT' stands for Maatschappelijke Diensttijd, which translates to Social Service Time; a period during which you will realize the significant impact you can make as a volunteer for society and for others, while also getting to know yourself better. You will meet new people and contribute to strengthening our society.\n\nThe Impact Bivouac is a three-day continuous bivouac, including overnight stays. During the bivouac, you will be challenged both physically and mentally at your own level. You will learn various military skills and drills, work on your personal leadership, and tackle diverse challenges with your team. You won't be alone during the bivouac; each team is guided by a military instructor and a professional coach who will help you explore the personal impact of these days on you. Additionally, you will be paired with a buddy with whom you will support each other throughout the Mission.\n\nDuring the Social Mission, you will dedicate 40 hours to voluntary work for society. You will be connected with a network or mentor in your region. The Social Missions cover a wide range of activities, but the key is to find something that suits you and that you enjoy doing. It could involve being a language buddy, helping elderly people with social media, or volunteering at your own sports club or scouting group. You can come up with ideas yourself or, even better, look around to find enjoyable places to contribute. The more proactive you are, the sooner you'll find a place that truly matches your interests and skills",
