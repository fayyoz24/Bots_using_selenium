    "summary": "I am on the mission to inspire and empower people to make the world healthier and more sustainable by building engaging communities. \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf31 \n\nAs a global citizen from Taiwan and have been lived in 3 continents and 8 countries, I\u2019m wired for connection and intrigued by the collective goods people can achieve together. In my free time I do yoga & acrobatic, spend time with friends and family, and travel extensively. Meeting people around the world makes me feel humble and energized to keep nudging for a more sustainable and inclusive world.\n\nHaving the privilege to meet many inspiring leaders and mentors who walk the talks and lead by examples, I believe that motivation and inspiration bring up the best in people. I\u2019m building the sustainability community by inspiring people with stories and knowledge and getting people together to call deep down in their courage to create the impacts we want for our future.\n\nI am also an active member of the Philips\u2019 #bethechange network, driving sustainability initiatives across the organization and supporting inclusion and diversity movement bottom up. \n\nThis year I am representing Philips as 1 of the 3 representatives globally to attend the Nudge Global Impact Challenge, developing an impact plan that contributes to sustainability. I also spoke at events and panels such as at the 2019 Philips International Women\u2019s Day event and #SustainabilityTalk.\n\n<Sustainability at Philips>\nPhilips is a clear frontrunner in sustainability and our achievement is increasing recognized by investors, customers, supply chain partners, and talents seeking to work with us. To stay on track of our ambitions, however, we need everyone at Philips to drive our sustainability collectively. If we can further align the personal passions and purpose of our colleagues with our company purpose, we can be a tremendously strong force for impact. \n\nThat's why we are engaging our sustainability community not only by encouraging voluntary work towards sustainability but more importantly, embedding sustainability into everything we do!",
