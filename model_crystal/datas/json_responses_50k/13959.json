    "summary": "Currently pursuing my MSc in Project Management at UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. Graduate of Political Science (BSc - Honours) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA).\n\nMost recently worked as a Tesla Support Advisor operating out of the Amsterdam offices and serving the EMEA region, specializing in the Francophone and French-speaking demographic.\n\nI attended and completed high school at the United World College in Mostar, an international school in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. UWC's mission is making education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future. My two years in Mostar were spent learning in a diverse environment of students coming from more than 50 different countries in the world, and allowed me to develop my academic and personal interests in a stimulating and unique surrounding.\n\nI completed my BSc in Amsterdam, specializing in International Relations and with a keen interest in politics and economics. Studying in Amsterdam provided me with opportunities to explore these interests outside of academics, notably through joining student political party 020 and other professional possibilities.",
