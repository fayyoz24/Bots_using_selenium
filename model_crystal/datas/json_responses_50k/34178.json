    "summary": "I have about 13 years of work experience as a project manager, consultant and manager in the field of spatial planning, environment and safety. Through my expertise in the energy and (petro)chemical sector in combination with a study background in geography, spatial planning and Latin American Studies, I combine technical skills with strong interpersonal and cultural skills.\n\nI gained my professional experience in the private and public domain. I have worked on a multitude of projects both in the Netherlands and internationally, i.e. in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, from (conceptual) territorial development to detailed design. Since 2019 I have been working as an advisor in the field of safety at Rijkswaterstaat.\n\nColleagues call me involved, result-oriented and honest. I can quickly familiarize myself with new material and I am able to perform under pressure. I enjoy working in a team and striving for high-quality results together. Customer-oriented, flexible and responsible are three other terms that describe me.",
