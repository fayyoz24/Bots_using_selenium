In addition, the project tested the applicability of the two frameworks in order to determine whether or not the cultural dimensions of the frameworks are reflected in real life experiences at the workplace \u2013 in this case as represented through the film Fear and Trembling.\nThe analysis revealed that intercultural communication challenges arise due to different cultural values and a lack of mutual understanding and knowledge of foreign culture(s). Thus, intercultural communication challenges arise when interactants in an intercultural collaboration demonstrate interculturally incompetent behaviour. The important intercultural communication competencies that are needed in order for a Japanese-Belgian collaboration to be successful - or any intercultural collaboration - hence, revolve around cultural awareness.",
