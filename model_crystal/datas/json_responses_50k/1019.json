My study eventually excluded large areas and suggested areas where a deep geothermal project was feasible for Transmark. \n\nIn addition, I was involved in the interpretation of well testing data and estimating bottom hole temperatures in Transmark Renewables's geothermal KOC-02 well with a numerical formation temperature recovery model based on Python",
