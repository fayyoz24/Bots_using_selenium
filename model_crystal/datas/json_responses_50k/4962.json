An avid hiker and outdoor adventurist. \nIn my quest towards career development, I am looking to also pursue an iPEC certified coach training program as I aim to further specialize in executive & leadership coaching and further in health & well-being coaching.   \n\n\nSkills:  Excellent communicator, strong analytical and organizational skills, bi-lingual, problem-solving mindset, critical thinker, strong work ethic, team worker, adaptive to change.",

My role included inviting the children (from their rooms) to the center's educational/play room, where we would play together, talk, read stories, and simply have an enjoyable time."
