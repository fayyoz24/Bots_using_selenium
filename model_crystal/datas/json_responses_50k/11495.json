Since its inception in 2013, DfX has played a fundamental role in procurement\u2019s ability, in collaboration with other business functions, to address total end-to-end cost. Alongside decision makers from across the business,including marketing, product management, R&D, operations and finance, procurement has used its reach and influence to embrace innovation and unlock potential product cost reductions. By interrogating the way Philips designs, manufacturers and delivers its products and solutions, procurement is perfectly placed to bring that influence to bear across the value chain. With X\u2019 representing the major variables that can impact on total cost over the product life cycle, procurement has set the standard for a company-wide optimisation tool and ensured that this holistic approach is about far more than simply delivering savings. It is, in short, bringing the X factor to procurement. ",
