Being it by automating things as Developer, working with a team to build Automation Software as Product Owner, or working on the team itself as Team Lead, I live for improving things. I\u2019ve always been interested in how we can do our work better: introducing Version Control and Release Management, organising Lightning Talks and Code Labs, shortening the feedback loop between Stakeholders, Testers and Developers. Always questioning the status quo, but never confusing \u201cnew\u201d with \u201cbetter\u201d. Valuing taking a first step over knowing exactly where to end up. Practical, pragmatic, passionate, conscientious, creative, outgoing.\n",

The GOTCHA system uses fiber optics and spectral analysis to detect trains and measure their burden  on the rails. It\u2019s also able to detect defects on wheels. This required a lens to be aligned and focused to a fibre optic cable. For the next generation of GOTCHA we developed a new sensor that uses fiber bragg gratings coupled to a CCD array and digital signal processing unit.",
