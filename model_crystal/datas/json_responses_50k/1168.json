The personal pursuit is a part of the ATLAS curriculum, which enables students to spend 10% of their curriculum (6 EC per year) to develop themselves in a certain area, in which they are very interested and passionate about. Before students can start with their personal project, they need to write a PP-proposal in which they elaborate on their plans in order to get approval of the Personal Pursuit committee.\nI'm touring one of our first year students who wants to fill in his Personal Pursuit with studying the Japanese language and culture. He has been passionate about Japan for years now and lived with a Japanese host family for 4 weeks and now he is preparing himself to study at a Japanese university in 2018.",
