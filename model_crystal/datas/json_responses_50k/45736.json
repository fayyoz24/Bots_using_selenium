    "summary": "I am doing Security Studies and I have a previous degree in Lettere, Musica e spettacolo. I travelled a lot in between university and that is how I spoke four different languages: Italian, English, Spanish and German. \n\nWhile growing up, I did ballet and the boy scout. From when I was 6 years old till 22 years old I did ballet and I sometime also taught it. This has helped me developed skills, such as endurance, temperance, discipline, precision. For ten years, I was in the boy scout, with the AGESCI association. Team work, creativity, respect and leadership are all skills that I have been developing since I was 8 years old. My local church asked me if I was available for teaching Sunday school to kids, so I did it for years, until I was in University. \nWhile I was attending my 4th year of private high school, the headteacher gave me and another girl the job of giving math after-class lesson to student in middle school for a couple of months. We had the same science teacher. \n\nThese experiences are not work related, but I grew up at a young age developing a suitable set of very useful skills. When I work in restaurants and hotel I could develop further these skills and put to the test what I already knew. I was a team-leader, and I had to supervise different departments and see problems for all the sides. The previous experience, especially creativity and emergency management, came in handy. I can solve problem fast and thinking outside the box. This is also why I am good at university: according to my last teammates, I am good at seeing where problems could arise, and bring to the table different viewpoints. \n\nAt university, these skills came again in handy. In the last three years, I had to work different time in group project, and that means that I had to work with different groups.The challenge part comes up when teammates cannot stick t doing their jobs and/or respect deadlines. Creativity, stress-management, problem-solving and leadership have all been put to test different times during my bachelor's years. \nIn the different groups I took positions, from team-leader to a simple member, I am flexible and I want to help other developing the same set of skill that I possess. The last group project comprised answering a research question posed to us by the ICCT; at the end of the 7 weeks deadline, we gave a presentation: communication, public-speaking and presenting have been tested. I am good at stress: deadlines at university can be stressful situation, but they have strengthened me and taught me how to prioritize and take care of my mental health.",
