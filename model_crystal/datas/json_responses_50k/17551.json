Whether a series of art exhibitions, panel talks, performances or skate competitions, the goal is always to amplify the voices around them.\n\nWorking alongside the Platform Founders, I have been involved in the production of events through the selection of tattoo artists, organization of logistics prior to, and during each event, as well as ensuring the oversight of activity. I joined the team prior to The Platform\u2019s third edition at Skatepark NOORD which had an attendance of 780 guests. We are currently in residence with Kanaal40, having had two successful editions at full capacity with around 350 guests. The sales within the tattoo division have doubled from each previous event, growing at the rate of 200%.\n\nManaging the Tattoo Division through its polarities; creative curating on one hand and licensing & safety on the other, has further motivated me to take advantage of this knowledge. I founded the Platform Basement in September 2022, a private studio space with the goal of allowing invited artists to create and collaborate. This studio is a space of exploration under which I coordinated an Artist in Residence program in collaboration with GastArt. Furthermore, tattoo artists traveling from abroad to participate in the platform\u2019s event have the possibility of tattooing in the studio; taking full advantage of exposure from the event and/or tapping into their customer base in the Netherlands.",

Through creating and curating content with CF Spark with more than 3770 images, I aided developers in understanding its patterns and areas of improvement. I tested its limits through each phase of development to determine which tools need more attention. \n\nTraining CF Spark to produce realistic and coherent images through diverse categories (sculptures, clip art, photography etc\u2026) further resulted in the creation of Promptomania; a public prompt builder with the goal of facilitating users in achieving satisfactory images. I therefore tested categories such as; art mediums, materials, colors, descriptive adjectives, dimensionality, geometry, lighting, artists\u2019 techniques and stylistic trends, to determine which words or word combinations CF Spark deciphers best. The successful wordings are currently available to use in Promptonia\u2019s PromptBuilder.",

My bachelor thesis was furthermore a result of my exploration into the themes of digitalization; by conducting an ethnographic research on the influence of Instagram on the tattoo industry. \n\nWithin my practice, I channel creativity through experimentation. Whether through unconventional stencil techniques, intricate color choices or diversifying design inspiration; I chose to question the boundaries of this medium.
