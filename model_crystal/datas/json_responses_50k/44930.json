    "summary": "I'm an applied physicist with a preference for fluid dynamics. I have gained a lot of experience in the hydraulic design of civil hydraulic structures during my years at Deltares. I enjoy working with numerical models of various complexity but prefer working with CFD models. I've been working with CFD since my MSc project and have applied CFD during all my years at Deltares. I've been part of the Deltares project team for iconic projects as the new sea locks at IJmuiden and Terneuzen in which I was part of the team that performed the numerical modelling (CFD and other models) or auditing the modelling effort of the contractor on behalf of our client. Next to CFD I have used less complex numerical models (i.e. Lockfill, Wanda) or bespoke scripts in Matlab or Python to perform my work. And although I haven't performed physical scale model experiments myself I've been involved in scale model work and using scale model results as verification for numerical models.\n\nIn my work I always strive to a high degree of quality and honesty, both in analysis as well as in reporting. I don't like to make results prettier than they are, but they should be presented in a pretty way. I am persevering in getting the job done, I won't give up so easily when a simulation doesn't work. I like to explore new topics to work on or new ways to model things. I enjoy working in a team, working towards a common goal.",

Among others this involves design and modeling of filling and emptying systems of navigation locks, hydraulic assessment of pumping station operation etc.. For my advice I use a combination of technical handbooks, custom calculation tools and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Recent years I've been focussing my efforts mainly on projects involving CFD. I've been working to widening the use of CFD within Deltares within the realm of hydraulic structures and industrial infrastructure by increasing the simulation quality and improving workflow. I work both as project engineer or project leader, performing analysis, reporting results and writing proposals.",
