    "summary": "Helping others find their confidence is at the core of everything I do. For me, it\u2019s all about how I can help you find ways to empower yourself. \n\nI try to do so every single day by using a creative mindset. In today\u2019s world, we have to be innovative to make a difference. But we also have to pay attention to the details, which is where my analytical, data-focused approach comes in. Always the realist, I maintain a critical attitude so that I can maximise what I do, for you.\n\nCreating long-lasting partnerships, branding concepts and strategic projects are just some of the ways in which I actualize all of the above. For example, developing and maintaining close relationships with business partners within my previous positions, creating a branding concept for my family members\u2019 business or re-organising my alma mater\u2019s Study Council as chair. Or, simply, helping a friend touch up their CV. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about how I can help you, so that you can find your confidence to do whatever it is you want to do. \n\n---\n\n5 Fun Facts You Should Know About Me\n\n\ud83d\udd11 I value honesty over everything. I\u2019m straight up about what I think and feel whether that\u2019s in my personal life or in business.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f My life motto reads \u201ceven if the door is closed, the window is still open\u201d. Where there's a will, there\u2019s a way.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Being creative make my heart tick - I love messing around on procreate, canva, photoshop, you name it.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 I\u2019m originally from Israel, and am most comfortable in an international context - I feel I thrive when I work in a team with multiple cultures.\n\n\ud83d\udcd3I\u2019m an avid reader and there is always a minimum of 2 books on my nightstand.",
