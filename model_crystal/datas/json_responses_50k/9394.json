    "summary": "I am currently working as a Teacher and Coordinator of the Disruptive Events Minor at Avans University of Applied Sciences. In this role, I strive to inspire students to ignite their interest in themes related to migration, climate change, and disaster relief and encourage them to come up with creative solutions to the real world problems around them.  \n\nI lecture courses within the minor, develop the curriculum, plan study trips, organize educational events, and work with students to ensure they get the most out of the minor program. \n\nI am passionate about taking an empathetic and human-centric approach to my work and collaborating with others to reach common goals and expand scientific knowledge. My other research interests include (forced) migration, international human rights, and Latin American politics.",
