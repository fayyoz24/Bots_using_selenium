Het initiatief wordt door een groot aantal Nobelprijswinnaars ondersteund. Het bestuur, unaniem in zijn beslissing, vindt het werk van Van den Heuvel niet alleen bijzonder en lovenswaardig, maar prijst de programmamaker ook omdat de primaire belangen van de desbetreffende kinderen nooit in het geding zijn.\n\n\u201cDat laatste is het allerbelangrijkste\u201d, vindt Van den Heuvel. \u201cHet mag nooit over hun rug gaan. Daar zou ik ook nooit voldoening uit kunnen halen. Toen RTL met het idee kwam, heb ik meteen gezegd: we gaan kinderen helpen door ze in een veilige situatie te brengen. Mijn andere programma\u2019s gaan over boeven vangen, dit gaat over kinderen. Het is mooi dat ChildRight dat heeft opgepikt.\u201d\n\n\u201cRTL heeft destijds enorm zijn nek uitgestoken. Het is een controversieel onderwerp, er werd met argusogen naar gekeken.\u201d Intussen is Van den Heuvel al bezig met het maken van zijn vierde seizoen. \u201cWat mij betreft kunnen we er nog lang mee doorgaan. Het is een enorme uitdaging de camera in te zetten om iets gedaan te krijgen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIk heb zelfs nog contact met ouders en kinderen uit de eerste serie. In veruit de meeste gevallen kunnen we concluderen dat we goed werk hebben verricht. Wat we willen, is dat kinderen contact houden met beide ouders. Vaak lukt dat. Er zijn gevallen bij waarin ouders hun ontvoerde kind nooit meer gezien zouden hebben als wij het programma niet hadden gemaakt.\u201d\n\nEr gaat zelfs een preventieve werking uit. \u201cNa twee seizoenen begon de marechaussee plotseling streng te controleren op minderjarigen die met \u00e9\u00e9n ouder op reis gingen. Het is kinderlijk eenvoudig een kind te ontvoeren. Dat probleem is nu beter op de kaart gezet.\u201d",

Hij bleek nog gewoner dan iedereen al vermoedde en stak dat in De Bauers niet onder stoelen of banken.
