            "description": "Information security threats to organisations have changed completely over the last decade, due to the complexity and dynamic nature of infrastructures and attacks. Successful attacks cost society billions a year, impacting vital services and the economy. Examples include StuxNet, using infected USB sticks to sabotage nuclear plants, and the DigiNotar attack, using fake digital certificates to spy on website traffic. New attacks cleverly exploit multiple organisational vulnerabilities, involving physical security and human behaviour. Defenders need to make rapid decisions regarding which attacks to block, as both infrastructure and attacker knowledge change rapidly.\n\nCurrent risk management methods provide descriptive tools for assessing threats by systematic brainstorming. Attack opportunities will be identified and prevented only if people can conceive them. In today\u2019s dynamic attack landscape, this process is too slow and exceeds the limits of human imaginative capability. Emerging security risks demand tool support to predict, prioritise, and prevent complex attacks systematically.\n\nThe TREsPASS project will make this possible, by building an \u201cattack navigator\u201d. This navigator makes it possible to say which attack opportunities are possible, which of them are the most urgent, and which countermeasures are most effective. To this end, the project combines knowledge from technical sciences (how vulnerable are protocols and software), social sciences (how likely are people to succumb to social engineering), and state-of-the-art industry processes and tools.\n\nBy integrating European expertise on socio-technical security into a widely applicable and standardised framework, TREsPASS will reduce security incidents in Europe, and allow organisations and their customers to make informed decisions about security investments. This increased resilience of European businesses both large and small is vital to safeguarding the social and economic prospects of Europe.",

Stol et al, Verkenning Cybercrime in Nederland, 2009) reported that cyber crime is less than 1% of the total amount of crime. It is plausible that this figure is related to the way this research was performed. Stol et al searched for the mentioning of the word \u2018cyber crime\u2019 or related terms  (e.g., computer crime) in electronic data-bases of the police.\n\n \n\nIn the present study an alternative path for searching in the police files will be followed: we will select at random \u2018traditional crime\u2019  and in a careful reading of this file, investigate whether digital modus operandi have been used by the offender. In other words, this study describes the influence of modern media (ICT, mobile phones) on 'traditional' crimes by examining how crimes like burglary, robbery and fraud are permeated by IT and other modern media.",

The methodology concentrates on the application of methods for hazard assessment, elements at risk mapping, vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and the development of GIS-based risk scenarios for varying hazard scenarios and vulnerability reduction options, using structural and/or non-structural measures. The methods for risk assessment that are applied depend on the availability of existing data, and range from simple loss estimations based on historic information to more complex methods based on modeling. In the development of elements at risk databases use is made of interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, combined with extensive field data collection, using mobile GIS. Also local communities are involved in the collection of vulnerability information, and in the evaluation of social vulnerability and capacity. Although the methodology is primarily designed to assist municipalities in the decision-making regarding vulnerability reduction strategies, the resulting databases are designed in such a way that they can also be utilized for other municipal activities.\nWithin the project a number of case study cities have been identified. The city of Naga in the Philippines has been selected for flood risk management, and the cities of Lalitpur in Nepal and Dehradun in India for seismic risk management. ",
