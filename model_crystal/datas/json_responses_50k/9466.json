    "summary": "I have completed my Bachelor's degree in International Relations at Corvinus University of Budapest, where I specialized in the understanding of the European integration process, and wrote my thesis on Brexit and its effect on the British constitutional monarchy. After my bachelor studies, I acquired my Master's degree in International Law and Global Governance at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, specializing in Human Rights. My thesis discussed Climate Change Denialism as a Crime Against Humanity and the Rights of Future Generations. \n\nCurrently seeking an opportunity to contribute to the work of an International Organization or an (I)NGO with the knowledge I have obtained during my studies, and consequently to the resolution of some of our most pressing issues as humanity, such as climate change, human rights abuses and the rise of populism.",
