    "summary": "Key Proficiencies: Self-starter | Highly Adaptable | Perseverant | Critical Thinker | Analyzer | Team-player\n\nPhD Candidate in Supply Chain Management. Master of International Business (MIB) from Smith School of Business and Master of Science (MSc) in Supply Chain Management from Maastricht University. Recently, I successfully completed two graduate degrees in Canada and the Netherlands, and over the years I've acquired professional experience in Germany, Czech Republic and Mexico.\n\nI thrive in situations that are eminently demanding, which I have demonstrated on several occasions in academia as well as within the automotive and pharmaceutical industry. I developed vital communication and critical thinking skills via many international (team) projects that involved assignments related to different business fields, such as Supply Chain Management, Strategy, and Consulting. In addition, I deeply value team spirit that emphasizes collaboration and mutual accountability, as experienced extensively through my 20+ years of playing soccer. \n",
