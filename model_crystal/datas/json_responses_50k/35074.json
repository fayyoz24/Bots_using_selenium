I oversaw pipelines for three Regional Investment Managers and my activities amongst others included:\n\n- Heading a team of analysts dedicated to building and evaluating deal flow.\n- Working alongside ESG teams in guiding project developers in incorporating risk mitigation strategies through tailored work packages of technical assistance (TA) or development grants.\n- Assisting project developers in enhancing their documentation to meet the Investment Committee (IC) standards, which includes creating clear IC summary forms, refining governance structures, improving contracts, and optimizing financial models.\n- Effectively managing project developer expectations regarding procedure timelines, providing transparent communication throughout, and actively assisting promising projects in their journey towards readiness for future steps.",
