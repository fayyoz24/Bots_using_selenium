    "summary": "In short: experience in payments, IT and innovation, leading cross-functional teams, financial industry.\n\nI am practiced in product management, market research, and in execution of cross-domain / international projects and initiatives. I used to work on creation and delivery of the product vision and roadmaps but also on business model innovation. \n\nI participated in the set-up of ING start-up Payconiq and set up and initiated two other start up initiatives in ING\u2019s accelerator. I am experienced in facilitating both bottom-up ideation sessions and customer research / interviews; I know how to ask right questions.  The most enjoyable work environment to me is where you combine strategic insight with strong delivery culture, levelling short-term goals and long-term vision.\n\nOver years I\u2019ve also got affinity with legal and operational complexities in e.g. setting up and negotiating contracts with [strategic] partners including outsourcing scenarios. I am also familiar with regulations in cash management and payments in Europe.  \nI also fulfilled portfolio management roles where I organised multi-country research and projects.\n\nAlways operating in multicultural environment, I developed empathy, people skills and affinity with international business practices. Committed to the \u201cbig picture\u201d, I am practical, driven, and optimistic",
