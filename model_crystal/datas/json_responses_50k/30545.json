This project started during the second year of our studies at Fontys University of Applied Sciences and consists of a team of 7 students. We worked diligently with Solidworks CAD software and learnt how to efficiently design and simulate our mechanical parts to ensure success with the real-life model. My contribution to the project was the design of the body supporting beams and the component holders for the electronics. During the production phase I worked soldering and wiring all components and manufacturing of the power distribution module. \n\nThe outcome proved to be highly successful with the drone being able to fly with extensive maneuvers without any failures. \n\nWe now proceed the project with the development of our own control unit.",

            "description": "I was the lead programmer and co-manager for a three quarter long project during the first year at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. Our goal as to build an autonomous rover & pickup system that could follow a custom defined field and pick up objects up to 60 centimeters away at different heights . As the co-manager I helped ensure that all tasks were done before deadlines and worked in with the sub-teams assisting in what was needed and giving feedback on the results. As the lead programmer, I contributed using MATLAB to simulate the arm design ideas and find the optimal one for the picking mechanism, designing a state-machine which would handle the rover operation and applying inverse kinematics to control the arm movement.
