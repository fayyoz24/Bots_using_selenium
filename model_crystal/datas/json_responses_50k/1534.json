    "summary": "I am a founding partner and member of the board of directors  'MAVERICKS Advancing Higher Education', an international group of independent advisors. \nBrussels based MAVERICKS acts globally as a sparring partner for universities, networks, public authorities, non-governmental organisations, companies and media outlets. \n\nUntil May 2023 I was a funding advisor of Maastricht University and Maastricht University Medical Centre. It is my passion to connect and commit people and innovative ideas. Subsequently to select funding opportunities and transform them into competitive applications and effective projects. \nI\u2019m convinced that providing greater connectivity yields. Moreover connectivity helps to see \u2018the big picture\u2019 of systemic changes and the consequences for own institutional change. This helps to identify colleagues, stakeholders and value chain needed to meet your ambition and to deliver deliver results expected. Co-creators in the value chain improve the capacity to explore all potential impacts. Effective fund-raising too is a joint effort of all stakeholders. Bringing together expertise and skills in a complementary way has become a precondition to write and submit competitive proposals successfully.\n   \nI have worked with many people from different sectors, organisations and regions in Europe and  learned to appreciate their expertise and input. It is his conviction that commissioned research and innovation is a joint effort rather than carrying out an assignment. This experience helps to compile and analyse all information necessary to inform stakeholders choosing dedicated strategies and writing competitive funding applications and implementing supportive public affairs activities.  \nSome keywords: connecting and committing; acquisition of regional, national and international public and private funding opportunities; developing and writing competitive applications; exploring funding opportunities; meeting expected impacts; guidance and coaching; commissioned research; contract and project management; building consortia and drafting consortium agreements. .",
