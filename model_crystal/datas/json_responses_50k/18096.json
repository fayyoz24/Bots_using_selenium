We are a science-based innovation engine in materials and technology, here to help the industry further lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE): Same sun. More power.\u2122\nOur first breakthrough was an Anti-Reflective coating for glass. Today this single technology is enabling more than two hundred million solar panels to capture more of the sun\u2019s power. \nWhat next? Endurance backsheets for PV modules that help you generate more power; and a unique Anti-Soiling coating for hot, dry environments that reduces the soiling rate of PV modules and increases returns for investors.\nBoth technologies are already available \u2013 and more will follow as we continue to work in partnership with institutes, glass and module makers, project developers and energy providers to create the next generation of solar solutions. \nThe innovation race is on.
