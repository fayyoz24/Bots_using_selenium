He has conducted extensive archival searches over the past several years. They have resulted in a large number of archival materials that have not been examined before. However, while historical research often focuses on single case studies, this project is about a much larger scale. Thus, it becomes clear that knowledge transfer is a multidirectional and complex phenomenon. To effectively accomplish this project, a complexity science approach is necessary and an attempt to build a knowledge transfer model.",

The project shall fill significant gaps in the literature on twentieth-century Central and Eastern European history which, aside from a handful of scattered studies (written from a national or state perspective and being far from exhaustive), has not taken up the subject from a comparative perspective. This is all the more surprising since the events in question were mass-scale, culture-informing and played an important role in the reconstruction of collective identities, in addition to being concentrated in one part of Europe. The aim of the project is to situate the millennial celebrations within a broad theoretical perspective, including that of culture studies (especially visual studies, which have not been applied in investigating the subject so far) and historical studies (including an analysis of archival materials and contemporary publications). The project will reflect on the reasons for organising national and religious commemorations, the role that these played for the societies of different countries, the religious and nonreligious factors bearing on the festivities, and the historical and ideological debates sparked by the events (i.a. the inclusion of the millennial celebrations within the framework of the dispute on the significance of Czech history in Czechoslovakia; the alternative celebrations of 1000 years of Polish statehood organised by the communist party in Poland versus the Church commemorations of the thousandth anniversary of the baptism of Poland; the struggle for the primacy of Western or Eastern Christianity between the Croats and Serbs in Yugoslavia; the dispute concerning the continuation of the Kievan Rus tradition between Russia and Ukraine within the USSR).",

I have conducted extensive archival searches over the past several years. They have resulted in a large number of archival materials that have not been examined before. However, while historical research often focuses on single case studies, this project is on a much larger scale. Thus, it becomes clear that knowledge transfer is a multidirectional and complex phenomenon. To effectively accomplish this project, a complexity science approach is necessary as an attempt to build a knowledge transfer model.",
