It was an intensive, in-person program geared towards imparting entrepreneurial education and mentoring women, with a particular emphasis on refugee women who are ready to build an impactful business or initiative.\n\nI had the privilege of meeting and listening to many impact entrepreneurs who each individually in their own way shared their unique stories and business insights. The week was filled with inspiring personalities, work ethics and drive. Each story has added much value to my life and all the ladies in the room.\n\nTo say the least, I learned a lot. I was able to learn about entrepreneurship and innovation, coding, business plan development, accounting, finance, marketing skills, and much more! However, I was especially humbled by the incredible ladies that I met throughout this week. A lot of talent and potential. Each and every individual deserves to unleash their potential, and we can collectively say that not even the sky is the limit!\n\nThank you to everyone that made this week so memorable! I will take my learnings and apply it to the Buddy Program Maastricht, to further the job preparation of Refugees.",
