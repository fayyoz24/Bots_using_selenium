    "summary": "A recent graduate from the University for Peace in Costa Rica. I am following the Environmental, Development, and Peace program with a specialization in Climate Change. I became proficient in various aspects of environmental and development fields, such as climate justice, climate adaptation, forestry, water & waste management, urban sustainability, and more. \n\nI obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University College Utrecht in June 2021 with a focus on Political Science, Sociology, and Geography. I am someone who has had the privilege to live in many different countries and continents, sparking my interest in international relations and politics and making me adaptable and open-minded. The ongoing climate emergency and the undeniable consequences of humanity on the planet motivate me to study and, in the future, work towards transforming our society into a sustainable one.",
