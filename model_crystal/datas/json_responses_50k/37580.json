I developed HMC's noise mitigation activities, and was their noise mitigation engineer on an HVDC platform installation in the North Sea. This first experiment and its published noise mitigation results led to an Environmental award for noise reduction (link below).\n\nFor the Innovation department, I developed a Strategic initiative for 'Submerged Construction Capabilities', focused on expanding the ROV capabilities on HMC's vessels. Furthermore, I supervised an offshore engineer's master thesis on the 'Design of a heavy-lift ROV'.",
