This technology offers interesting perspectives to track different components within a phone. This make the \"Phone as a Service\" business model viable, where the production company keeps ownership of the phone, which creates an incentive for producing long-lasting electronics. It also makes recycling easier and enhances transparency in the production chain. \n\n* I also assisted my team with diverse tasks, like negotiating with data consultancy companies, and interviews for social media and the radio. \nhttps://www.nporadio5.nl/gemist/audio/359386/je-hebt-letterlijk-goud-in-je-la-liggen-alleen-weet-je-dat-waarschijnlijk-niet\n\n* Fairphone offers trainings by external consultants to their employees.
