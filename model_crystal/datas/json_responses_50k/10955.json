The alignment of Business & IT is essential in this aspect. Based on the vision and strategy of an organization, the business processes are improved and IT is applied smartly. This minor therefore revolves around processes and software applications such as ERP, CRM and BPM. During this minor, theory days at Utrecht University (HU) are alternated with practical days at AFAS Software. The learned theory could thus be applied directly in the field.\n\nMy final assignment was to visualize and categorize customer 'contact' moments, based on AFAS' existing customer data. Together with a fellow student, I delivered an intellegent dashboard in which this customer data can be displayed and analyzed in a clear and fast way. This dashboard was built in the Business Intellegence (BI) software Qlik Sense.",
