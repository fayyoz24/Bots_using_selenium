    "summary": "I have lived in 5 different European countries. I am proud to have friends from all over the world, I believe they made me who I am now. As a teenager, I trained track and field for 4 years, now I'm still a big sports fan, and I am especially passionate about football and its statistics. \n\nI worked as an associate recruiter in the logistics industry. During 1.5 years of work, I recruited 288 people, who signed contracts (on average 16 people per month). I maintained 66.5% of so-called \u2018arrivals\u2019 every month.\n\nMy goal is to gain a lot of knowledge and enhance my professional qualifications in various administrative fields. My area of interest includes event organization and management, project management, talent management, office management, personal/executive assistance, HR support, administrative matters, and employee training. \n\nI consider myself an extrovert, I seek to bring good vibes to the office in order to spread positive energy among the employees and help them solve emerging problems. I'm not a fan of micromanagement and tight control but I greatly appreciate constructive criticism.",
