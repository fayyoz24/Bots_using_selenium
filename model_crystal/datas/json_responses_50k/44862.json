Developyn has been working with BetSquad since November 2017 to help with both with their cloud architecture and to build their back-end APIs.\n\nAs there were no existing APIs, we were able to design the architecture from scratch and had little legacy code to consider which could get in the way. Considering BetSquad's needs, as a lean and agile start-up with a limited budget, we needed to ensure that the architecture and language we chose wouldn't be something that would have a negative impact on them in the future.\n\nKeeping these considerations in mind, we chose to use AWS's EC2 (with Amazon Linux 2) service. EC2 is quick, easy and cheap to setup. At a cost of only \u00a35 per server and with the ability to serve thousands of requests each day, a fleet of t2.nano instances was more than enough to cope with BetSquad's demand during their start-up. Another bonus of this infrastructure is that it's self-scaling and requires no input from Developyn after it has been set up.\n\nTo serve the API requests, we configured Nginx as a reverse proxy for Node (using ExpressJS). While Node may not be the most optimal language to use when serving potentially millions of users, it's extremely quick to write in and is easy enough to understand by any potential future developers on the project. Another particularly nice feature is Node.js is its asynchronous design, as long as the code avoids blocking the event loop, it makes it rather easy to max our the performance of our tiny t2.nano machines with no need to worry about multi-threading pools and locking up.",

NubeGo required a software solution to create, edit and send out cloud questionnaires to clients to be able to determine their ability to move from in-house hardware to the cloud.\n\nThe stack we chose was: Vue.js, Bulma, Node.js (& Nginx, Amazon Linux 2) and MySQL (which was later moved to Aurora Serverless). These technologies encourage rapid prototyping and development, reducing the overall cost of the project and reducing the required budget.\n\nAuthentication is delegated to Google's OAuth2 authentication service (using JSON Web Tokens), this reduces administrative burden on NubeGo and the use of JWT's allows for the easy separation of the front and back-end. The rest of the architecture follows a design that ensures no 2 components are tightly coupled, this allows for NubeGo to easily scale up and down a fleet of front and back-end servers based on their respective demands.",

At peak it was seeing 1000 user sign-ups a day.\n\nAll infrastructure was managed through the use of Terraform and the Serverless Framework allowing for version control and collaboration at the infrastructure level making it extremely easy to spin up and down new environments for development and QA testing.\n\nDesigned and implemented custom CI/CD pipeline to detect changes and deploy relevant services.
