Inspired by the TED talk \"The danger of a Single Story\" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie we developed the concept of Second Stories to break Single Stories and turn them into multi-facetted stories. Depending on the nature of it, a Single Story quickly leads to exclusion and discrimination of those affected by it. Our platform, SpreadSecondStories is here to give storytelling power to people who feel that a Single Story wrongly represents them. We enable you to meet the humans that Single Stories usually hide behind stereotypes.",
