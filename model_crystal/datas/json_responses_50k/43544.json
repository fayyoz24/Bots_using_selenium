    "summary": "I believe that design is a very powerful tool to bring about change in the habits & beliefs of society. I firmly believe \u2013 \u2018Design creates culture. Culture shapes values. Values determine the future.\u2019- Robert L. Peters.\n\nFor me, Designing simply means \u2018Exploration, Experience & Uniqueness\u2019. I am a keen observer, I learn many things by imagining virtual walkthroughs through natural and human-made things, understand their purpose, and get inspired by them. My design objective is quite focused on asking the right logical questions and solving real problems to impact society and nature positively.\n\nBeing a mechanical engineer and a designer, I can effectively bridge the gaps between conceptualization and actualization and have a firm grasp of product implementation. I am skilled in research, context mapping (i.e. defining the problem so well that it leads to a solution), conceptualization, prototyping/ fabrication/ manufacturing & analysis. I have an intuitive approach to learning new technologies and can incorporate them into my design practice to bring out the best product experience for the users.\n\nSome of my hobbies are exploring nature and cultures, making films & documentaries, dancing, etc. These days, I am focusing on learning the role of behavioural sciences in design processes, exploring new methodologies for a deeper understanding of design context & developing a more dynamic approach towards managing the design process.",

Successfully working prototypes of the following appliances were achieved at the end of the project.\n\nTeleCook\n\nThis product was designed for the working class, the bachelors, or the old aged. A smart rice cooker with a cellular connection that could be ordered to cook rice automatically from a cell phone application. The quantity and consistency of rice could be controlled as well. The use case could be extended to make other dishes that are prepared by steaming.\n\nForetele & Holmes\n\nThis appliance was aimed to improve safety in the Indian kitchen concerning the LPG cylinders. It senses leakages above the permissible threshold and notifies the user to cut the supply. If the user is unable to do so, the system will cut off the supply by itself. It also senses the current level of LPG in the cylinder, and using machine learning algorithms, predicts the day when it will run out. It can place an order for a new one automatically if enabled.\n\nDrySense\n\nA smart drying rack for clothes aimed to reduce the daily work of Indian homemakers. DrySense detects when the clothes on the rack are completely dry and automatically collects them all into a basket.\n\nAura\n\nA centralized human presence sensing system that could automatically control the lights in a room using multiple infrared sensors and a suitable logic for processing the sensor information.",

It has become a platform for students all over India to hear and interact with the leading minds of today. Abhigyan has set a benchmark by gathering an audience of 1200+ students and professionals each year for the past 6 years.\n\nFor Abhigyan 2019, my responsibility as a Brand Manager was to establish the presence of the event in Maharashtra (mainly western and southern). As the head of a team of 18 people, I worked towards developing an elegant multi-facet brand image of the event by collaborating with the other committees of the event.\n\nThe branding strategy we implemented included - analysis of previous years to find the type of audience in focus, establishing a presence on social media, engaging the attendees by bringing transparency about the progress of the event through social media, day by day reveal of posters & promotional videos recorded by the guests/speakers, designing graphical content (starter kits, flyers, posters, posts, stories), venue arrangements for a seamless experience like the stage, screens, food court, registration counters, etc. The graphic design team worked constantly to maintain a constant theme in every aspect of communication to the audience. We also worked out the event day strategies like behavioral code, micro-level event schedule for various teams to make the execution extremely smooth and engaging to offer the audience a comfortable experience.\n\nBecause of this strategic execution, the participation count skyrocketed to 1800+ entries with the closing of entries 14 days before the event. This had never happened in Abhigyan's history. Looking at the feedback from the audience, I could confidently say that we succeeded in creating a positive and lasting impact on Abhigyan as well as the people who made it possible."
