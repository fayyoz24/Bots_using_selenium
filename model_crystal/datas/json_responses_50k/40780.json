    "summary": "ATTENTION: I am solely interested in working in either the Additive Manufacturing or the Sustainable Energy field. \n\nI completed a masters in Chemical Engineering, and an internship for DSM, in Basel. I am analytical, out of the box thinking, and multi-lingual. Traveling over the world and having multiple nationalities, I have learned to understand and communicate well with people from different cultures. I have often seen myself functioning as a bridge between parties, understanding and relaying what they mean. In my time at the TU Delft, I have developed analytical skills that allow me to quickly grasp what the core is of a matter at hand. I am objective focused and internationally oriented.  In a future job, I would look for plenty of human interaction, clear objectives, and international relationships. \n\nI\u2019m always open to new opportunities and to speak with new people. If you\u2019re interested in a zoom call, feel free to reach out to me by sending a message.",

This was done through the use of Additive Manufacturing. I created multiple types of impellors and tested them in a lab-scale experiment, resulting in a final impellor design. In this project, I perfected my planning skills, receiving multiple compliments from supervisors on how the project was managed. I also learned how to utilize SolidWorks and how to manufacture components through Additive Manufacturing.",
