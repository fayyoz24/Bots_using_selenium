    "summary": "As a researcher at the Access to Medicine Foundation, I contribute to the development and implementation of innovative tools and methods to assess and improve access to medicine for people in low- and middle-income countries. I apply my skills and knowledge in data analysis to conduct impactful research that can inform global health policies and practices.\n\nI completed my master's degree in Oncology and Cancer Biology from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. During my studies, I gained valuable experience in working on cutting-edge projects in collaboration with institutions, such as Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the Netherlands Cancer Institute. I worked on topics such as prime editing, intestinal stem cell plasticity, and oncogenomics, and co-authored two publications in Nature Communications. With a background in patient care and molecular biology, I endeavor to apply my skills and work for an innovative medical research company that can improve the quality of life for people on a global scale.",
