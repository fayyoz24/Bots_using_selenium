    "summary": "I am a recently graduated student International Business at Hogeschool Rotterdam. I have a hands-on mentality with aspirations to do a master's study in the same area of expertise I obtained my Bachelor. Currently, I am looking for work within the finance sector with a preference for banking. \n\nDuring my minor, I was part of an international case competition team for the Rotterdam Business School, and we had to solve complex real-time management problems. In addition, we had to pitch our strategy and implementation to the respective companies handing out the cases. I went with my team to the PanAmericana (online) case competition during this period. \n\nDuring my Bachelor degree, I learned principles of all managerial topics, how to handle/tackle specific problems, and how to solve these problems. For example, at my internship, I researched user growth opportunities through digital marketing at Jedlix; during this research, I had to apply multiple models & frameworks and conduct academic research.",
