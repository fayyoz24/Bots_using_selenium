Each year, awards are presented to the best Doctoral dissertation and to the best Master Thesis. In 2010, my thesis \u201cTrading Fundamental Human Rights for Security? An Analysis of the European Union\u201fs Counter-Terrorism Policy\u201d was awarded the Max van der Stoel Human Rights Award for Best Master Thesis.\n\nThe jury was composed of the following members.\n\u2022 Professor Peter Baehr, chairman of the jury, honorary professor of Human Rights at Utrecht University and former director of the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights,\n\u2022 Professor Stephan Parmentier, professor of criminology and human rights at the Catholic University of Leuven and former vice-president of the Flanders branch of Amnesty International,\n\u2022 Dr. Marlies Glasius, senior lecturer in International Relations at the Department of Political Science of the University of Amsterdam.\n\nThe jury report:\n\n\"Shahid's study explores to what extent the European Union has adhered to the fundamental human rights and civil liberties of its citizens when applying several counter-terrorist measures in the last five to ten years.\n\nShahid has produced a carefully written, well-documented, nicely ordered thesis on a complex subject. She aptly indicates the gaps in the EU legal framework and applies them to concrete situations. She clearly answers her central research question. The subject matter is one of the most crucial concerns relating to human rights in contemporary western societies.\"",
