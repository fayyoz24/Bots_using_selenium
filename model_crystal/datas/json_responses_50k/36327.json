    "summary": "Hi, I'm Beatriz. I'm currently a Consultant at Wholesale Banking Operations at ING in Amsterdam. I work with multiple teams from Client Services to Lending Operations with a general focus on supporting the management team on day to day improvements. Recently, I also took over the role as sustainability lead for the wholesale banking operations domain.\n\nMy background is on project management, with focus on delivering end-to-end IT and strategic programs. I'm skilled in stakeholder management, transparent communication, project ownership, hyper-delivery, with an educational background in Economics in Brazil and France. I'm best when I'm busy.\n\nSome of my interests are in program management, engagement & feedback, and leadership. On a personal note, I also take time for dancing, musicals and behavioural economics (nerdy I know). \n\nDrop me a message if you have something to discuss!\n\nSpecialties: Agile ; Waterfall ; Team work ; Stakeholder Management ; Activation",
