Guardians engage justice delivery organisations; courts, Bar associations, legislative bodies, village elders etc. to improves their processes to deliver more and better justice. HiiL and the Guardians will collect robust evidence about the justice needs of the people, the costs and quality of access to justice. This knowledge will be processed into a series of reports focusing on particular justice challenges. These civil society organisations are placed at centre-stage of the project and are empowered, in a partnership with HiiL, to become Guardians of Justice, thus giving voice to the people and instigating innovative and evidence-based change processes, tailored to local needs.",
