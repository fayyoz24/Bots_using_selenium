    "summary": "Hi! My name is Ali Aslan. I\u2019m a BSc: Political Science student (with a specialization for International Relations and Organizations) at Leiden University in the Netherlands. I'm interested in: Governmental Affairs & Contemporary Political Actions around the globe (as you can probably tell by my Bachelor). I have always been interested in current affairs of the globe and how these events come to be, along with what unforeseen results or consequences these actions may bring. I currently study my bachelor in The Hague, a very international city filled with consulates from every region of the world, bringing many different profiles of people that I have had to possibility to interact and broaden my perspectives with. The bachelor has also made me gain valuable skills within the department of research and data analysis, through numerous courses.\nI'm currently looking for either a full-time, a part-time job, or an internship that ideally focuses on intergovernmental affairs or is somewhat related to current global affairs.",
