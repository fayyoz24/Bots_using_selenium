    "summary": "I have extended experience as (interim) manager in governmental institutions, managing units for practical research on environment and sustainability and units in the field of executive support and development of policy. All included complex change management activities.\nI have a strong problem solving and goal oriented attitude and I have an open, communicative, coaching and supporting way of managing people. \nAs consultant I am able to easily gain the trust of relevant parties and to establish the broad basis for implementation of the necessary organisational changes. \nI approach environmental issues \u2013if possible- from the content, based on my environmental technology knowledge and experience in (waste) water treatment.\nI am highly interested in sustainable development possibilities for third world countries, also as a result of travelling through countries like Nepal, Latin-America, Sri Lanka, and an assessment mission in Colombia and an internship in Egypt.",
