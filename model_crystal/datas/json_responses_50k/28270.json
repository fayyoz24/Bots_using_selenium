    "summary": "Welcome to my profile! My name is Annabel Romijn, MSc in the field of Applied Physics and Science Education & Communication. I received my first master's degree in the summer of 2018 at Eindhoven University of Technology. During my master, I focused on bio-nanotechnology. Following this, I enrolled in a second master at TU/e, Science Education & Communication, because I was also interested in having an educational aspect to my career. In July 2019, I finished this master program and received my second MSc title with an average of 8.4, concerning a teachers degree in Physics ('eerstegraads docent natuurkunde'). Since August 2019 I have been working as a teacher.\n\nWhile studying at TU/e, I worked as a student advisor for the university. My role was to inform high school students about the possibilities of higher education at TU/e. Through this job, I was asked to present at the lustrumdies in front of 500 people. Consequently, I've hosted the Graduate School event of the TU/e in 2018, in front of 1100 people, gave presentations at the information days and was a host for the TEDx pitch event at our university. I also moderated the Business Core symposium, Famelab event and Pint of Science in Eindhoven in 2019. I consider myself fluent in giving presentations and talks. In 2019 I also participated in Expedition Spinvis, have been selected as Young European Talent, and for three subsequent years I've moderated the SensUs event at TU/e.\n\nTo further apply myself during my studies, I was a member of several committees at my study association and performed in two musicals by 'Het Nieuwe Theater' in Eindhoven. Currently, I practice photography frequently.\n\nFeel free to reach out via a LinkedIn message if you want to contact me. Thank you for visiting my profile.\n\nAnnabel Romijn",

During my research, I have created a method to quantify particle aggregation rates for non-specific interactions using the optomagnetic cluster assay. This allows quick quantification of aggregation rates, which allows the study of clustering of particles for different particles, different coatings (such as PEG, antibodies, enzymes) and thereby creates an understanding on how to improve biosensors and stability of particles in complex matrices such as blood.",
