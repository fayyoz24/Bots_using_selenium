This social MMO, named Hero World, was to be linked with their Hero retail games. For example, a user in Guitar Hero could create a character, and then continue with that same character in Hero World. Sadly Activision decided to kill their Hero franchise so the project was canceled.\n\nI was responsible for all the environments together with Jimmy de Meza. He did all the important buildings like the Neptunes store. While I created the rest of the map. Including lighting, rendering and managing the \u201cMaster\u201d file. Interns helped us with small props and some of the interiors.",

They soon started a selection process to create a fresh, newly created team. At around 15 people, we were given this enormous task and to complete it within a year! My biggest role was building and redefining the city of Donald Duck, known as Duckburg. Scattered with all the other tasks, this took me around 6 month to complete. Besides the city I have also worked on a lot of the environments for the mini games, creating particle effects and overall art style creation and protection together with the team. \u2013 Created in 2014.\n\nDuckworld Smart Adventures is now live!

It is based on a World War 2 setting with a twist towards over engineering and diesel punk hardware.\n\nMy part / task:\nMy job description was modeling units and props. However I have also spent a lot of time fixing the art style where possible, giving all units a massive overhaul to make sure they fit in their faction style, recreating old or ugly assets, cleaning up source files, help resolving art bugs, managing documents like art workflows and outsourcing docs, helping the mapping team with all their art needs, advising other teams or projects where possible. In general, when it came to anything that had to do with art, I was involved.\n\nPortfolio images:\nhttp://www.robertberrier.com/portfolio/march-of-war-warzeppelin/\nhttp://www.robertberrier.com/portfolio/march-of-war-hammer/\nhttp://www.robertberrier.com/portfolio/march-of-war-gorillamole/\nhttp://www.robertberrier.com/portfolio/march-of-war-sickle/\nhttp://www.robertberrier.com/portfolio/march-of-war-warelephant/",
