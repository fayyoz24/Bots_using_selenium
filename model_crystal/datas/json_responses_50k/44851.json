With this project, we tried to acquire ideas from the youth in Veendam to make Veendam a better place for youngsters. Gemeente Veendam placed some posters in the Winkler Prins buildings with a sketch of the idea on the posters. The project began when we had a group of students and city council members. We had some brainstorming sessions and created the project. We started a campaign to make this project the subject of Veendam. We also made an advertising spot and were active on social media. At the beginning of January, we sent all the collected ideas to the city council of Veendam. They choose, according to them, the three best and most viable concepts. With the whole team, especially the debate team of the Winkler Prins, we organised a final debate to make the winning idea clear. The debate found a place on the evening of Friday, eight March.",

The University Council consists of 12 students representing the student population and 12 staff members representing researchers and staff. As someone representing students last year, I was in contact with many students. The Faculty of Science and Engineering and the Faculty of Economics and Business were in my portfolio. Hence, I was in contact with all study associations and assessors of the Faculty of Science and Engineering and the Faculty of Economics and Business. As a faction, we worked on strategies to improve the university internally and externally. We were in close contact with student life and education.\n\nSOG tries to represent students in the best way possible. We find active student life, student well-being and sustainability important. In pursuing our ideals, we try to connect people and make changes internally and externally in the university.",
