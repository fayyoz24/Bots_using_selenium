Through the varied and intensive program of business tour, which included farm visits, B2B sessions and meetings with local authorities, the Dutch delegation learned about current state of agricultural sector and ambitious future projects in the area of livestock and poultry production. Every meeting closed with a \u201ccup of tea\u201d and tableful of ethnic treats, as is right and proper according to Russian tradition. The warm hospitality of Tatarstan has left an unforgettable impression on Dutch delegation and has shown that establishing contacts and building long-lasting relationships and plays most significant role in doing business in this country.\nIn this frame the representatives of the European Staff, playing the role of the Coordination Centre of FDRL, have done a tremendous job putting all connections together, making the execution of the mission program productive and successful.",
