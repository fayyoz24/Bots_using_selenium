    "summary": "I work with fast-growing companies - that want to continue growing fast.\n\nThey have fantastic talent on board.  Challenging targets.  Ambitious Strategies.  And no time to waste.  They understand that the faster you grow, the quicker you will face new challenges - Market, Structure, Processes, Personnel, Culture, Team, and Capacity.\n\nMy role is that of a seasoned sales leader who has worked with and in fast-growing companies.  One where we had five salespeople and grew it to 100 in 6 months.  Another 25 sales reps to 200 in 18 months.  Or 15 cold callers to 750 in 5 months.  \n\nWe go through the plan - Vision - Goals - Strategies - Team - GTM Plan - Processes.\nThe companies I work with are already outstanding, so 70% of their plan is world-class.  20% can be improved with a little polish - some tweaks here and there.  And 10% is where we introduce some new ideas to accelerate the process even further. \nWhen you're working fast, you don't have the time to triple-check everything.  And everything is brand new. So it's hard to know which bits of your planning is world-class - and which need to be improved. And have the time to take on board some new ideas.\n\nThat's what we do.  Once a month, we take 90 minutes to look at what the sales org plans to do - and point out what is excellent and what needs more work. Practical tips, models and examples are shared.  The team then goes into the month with extra confidence, clarity and conviction that they have a better plan.\n\nWe check in again during the month - briefly - to check that all is ok - and then onto the next month.\nNew challenges.  New situations.  New growing pains.  New market opportunities.\n\nSo, who am I?\nA salesman.  I love the whole sales process - developing the right value proposition, defining why people should buy a product and taking it to market. And then selling. And then scaling. And I've had the privilege to do this with some fantastic companies across the globe.\n\nFor over 20 years, I've been taking on sales targets and beating them - from selling space in phone books straight from university to running international, multi-channel sales and marketing teams. The most enjoyable part of my career has been working with groups of motivated individuals and transforming them into a winning team.\n\nSince finishing my last full-time role, I've worked as an advisor across Europe in developing ambitious strategies and sales organizations that drive growth and increase profitability.\nPassionate about helping individuals and teams succeed, with experience advising and coaching startups and scale-ups.",
