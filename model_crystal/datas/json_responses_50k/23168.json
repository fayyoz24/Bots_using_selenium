With the environmental awareness increasing day by day, need for a cleaner environment is becoming a priority for which, Trash management of an area plays a very important role. With the demand for waste collection rising and city budgets shrinking, innovation is required. \nIn this project, Trash collection is optimized using Wireless sensor Networks. A network of Trashcans is built, wherein Trashcans talk to each other, sense their status and provide information to the concerned authority about the steps to be taken. Each Trash collection unit sends a wireless signal to a central server where staff can see which machines are full, so managers can optimize collection routes in real-time based on data from every machine in the field. \nTools: ZigBee, XBee, GSM Module, Arduino, Embedded C, IR Sensor, Ultrasonic sensor\n\n",

This offers the advantage of remote medical diagnosis. It demonstrates how a single-chip microcontroller can be used to analyze heart rate in real-time. IR led is used as a source and a photodiode is used as a sensor. The heart rate in beats per minute is counted by the microcontroller and then it is transmitted using RF module. The receiver receives this data and displays the heart rate on the display unit.\nTools: Arduino, IR Sensor, RF Module, LCD.",
