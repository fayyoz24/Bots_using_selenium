    "summary": "A full stack developer with experience in React, node.js, Python and more. I'm motivated, highly creative and most happy where there is a problem to be solved. \n\nComing out of high school, the hardest problem to solve was figuring out where in the world I could add the most value. Should I pursue my love of performing and enroll in music or theatre school? Should I increase my involvement with youth activism and be an advocate for a better world? After grappling with this decision for a while, I decided to enroll in a BSc in mechanical engineering.  \n\nTwo years later and I couldn't take it any more. I made another tough decision and deregistered from the course. Devastating! I felt like a failure for choosing the wrong path after high school and an even bigger failure for not finishing what I started. But looking back, I remember the invaluable knowledge I gained from my time at university and how this has shaped the way I see the world.\n\nI learned to embrace difficulty, I learned how to solve problems, and I learned that as long as we do what we are passionate about, we can add value to the world. And every day, I continue to learn.\n\nMy passion is for solving problems. Nothing makes me happier than grappling with a tough question and finding the answer. I am proficient with most in-demand web development tools and have experience with training and client demonstrations.\n\nI am also passionate about music, film, football, and the world's next greatest art-form \u2013 video games. \n\nDo you share my passions?
