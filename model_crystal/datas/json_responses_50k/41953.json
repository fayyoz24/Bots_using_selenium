    "summary": "Hi there, my name's Nikola and I come from Bulgaria. I currently reside in the Netherlands, Eindhoven and I am in my second year of my Information and Communication Technologies study at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I've always had a interest in computers, ever since I was a toddler I remember I was glued to a computer. My major study is in ICT and Infrastructure and right now I am doing my specialization in ICT and Smart Industries. Infrastructure has always interested me, and knowing how anything with an access to the internet communicates has always grabbed my attention. In addition, working with terminals and automating anything with a couple lines of code and terminal commands has been quite fun for me. I've decided to specialize in Smart Industry because of my love for technology and my recently found interest in smart technology, IoT (Internet of Things), data analytics and machine learning. \n\nSince I enjoy solving problems and have been told I am good at that, any project with many problems in it is the one I am most likely to pick. The harder a problem is, the bigger the chance I would get obsessed with solving it. Beyond my studies in ICT, I am a big fan of the STEM fields and am even hoping that in the future I could become a researcher in the field of physics and astronomy. I have even managed to find ways where my ICT knowledge could be applied in these fields as well as help me prepare myself for them.",
