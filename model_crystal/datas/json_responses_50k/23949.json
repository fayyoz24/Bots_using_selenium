    "summary": "Welcome to my LinkedIn profile! \nLet me briefly introduce myself to you: my name is Nicolien and I am an enthusiastic and ambitious team player with 14 years of experience in IT. During high school I started working in several restaurants and bars. I loved the social and hospitable environment, so I decided to study in Maastricht at the hotelmanagement school where I could combine hospitality with my development in entrepreneural and business skills. To develop myself in more strategic and analytical business skills I finished my Master in Business Administration in Amsterdam and enjoyed active participation in a study association.\n\nNowadays, I am able to run my own business and manage my own business partners/customers. Building relationships, connecting and developing people to make it easier doing business with each other are things I like the most in my job. Always with keeping business growth in mind.\n\nFor and together with the partners I am looking for new business models to help our joint customers align with their strategic direction and find new ways to generate revenue, increase productivity and grow business in the digital economy. \n\nIn my sparetime, I like traveling and exploring nice places and cities all over the world, together with my husband and two young daughters. I am fanatic in crossfit and enjoy cooking in a healthy way. After a busy week I am catching up with friends in Amsterdam or I am relaxing at home listening to music and reading magazines.",
