    "summary": "I\u2019m a gladiator in a pencil skirt aka an influencer marketing and award-winning PR consultant.\n\nBoth my education and experience is steeped in communications with a BCom: Communication Management degree and vast experience in traditional and digital PR with some of South Africa's biggest PR agencies. This afforded me to work on some of the biggest brands like PPC, LG Mobile, P&G, Unilever, MTN, Nespresso and many others and some fantastic smaller brands. \n\nI've been privileged to work with some of the best minds in PR and been part of teams that won PRISM awards as well as a couple of the highly prestigious and coveted SABRE awards (aka the Oscars of PR). \n\nMy opinions on brands with regards to PR and influencer marketing have been published in the likes of The Media Online, Modern Marketing, Biz Community, Media Update, Evolve (a UK business website) and Journal of Strategic Marketing. I was featured on the cover of the latter publication in 2019. \n\nMy writing isn't only industry specific, I also write articles on lifestyle, tech, culture and travel. My work has been featured in Joburg Style, HuffPost (where I was a contributor until it closed down in South Africa) and Future Now to name a few. As part of my profession I also write content like press releases, blog posts and web copy in addition to editing and proof reading. \n\nI have been a speaker at the Social Media Conference as well as the Modern Marketing Trend Camp as an expert on influencer marketing to talk about the importance of influencers as a marketing channel for brands. \n\nI have been a guest on Cape Talk radio, PowerFM, Maggs on Media and The Fix on eNCA to discuss the above topics and been quoted in various articles by reputable journalists.",
