Therefore, the Program promotes what are today\u2019s crucial factors of success: entrepreneurialism, cross-cultural understanding and responsible leadership.\n\nStarting in 2019, the Swiss-California Foundation will relocate itself from Santa Rosa to San Francisco. In the San Francisco Bay Area, there is a strong presence of Swiss companies and organisations, which will allow me to interact with a diverse environment. In the form of projects and events I will be operating at the interface of various organizations, most of which have a direct connection to Switzerland. Those include swissnex San Francisco, the Consulate General of Switzerland in San Francisco, the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Zurich Area, Swisscom and Swiss Tourism. In addition to that, I will be co-presiding over HSG Alumni in San Francisco. \n\nContact: fabienne@swisscalifornia.com",
