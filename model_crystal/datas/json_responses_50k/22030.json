    "summary": "Geert (1966) is a civil law notary at the law firm MAES notarissen, specialising in corporate law, real estate, and estate planning. He is also a real estate investment professional and an entrepreneur. An analytical mind, dedicated, forthcoming, accommodating business partner, trusted advisor, team player and problem solver. \n\nGeert has been a civil law notary and full equity partner at the city law firm Simmons & Simmons and, subsequently, with Stibbe, Amsterdam office. As a notary and trusted advisor, he has advised a large number of companies in various sectors, as well as wealthy individuals and families in their strategic choices, and in implementing them. He has been named one of the \u201cleading individuals\u201d by Legal500, Chambers & Partners, Advocatie and PropertyNL. For what it is worth. Geert started his career in 1992 at Loeff Claeys Verbeke in Amsterdam, the legal predecessor of Loyens & Loeff and Allen & Overy. \n\nGeert studied law at Leiden University, obtained a master's degree in real estate and investment management (MRE) at the School of Real Estate (ASRE) of the University of Amsterdam and completed the Global Executive MBA programme organised by the five leading business schools in Asia, Europe and the Americas working together, namely: Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK); Escola de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de Empresas de S\u00e3o Paulo, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas (FGV); EGADE Business School, Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey; Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), Erasmus University; and Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).\n\nGeert is a good listener and a result-oriented negotiator. A MAEStro. Streetwise, empathetic, and succinct, he knows how to bring parties together. He has completed the Harvard Law School \u201cProgram on Negotiation\u201d and the MfN mediation programme but developed his negotiation and mediation skills based on practical experience handling a large number of varied cases.\n\nDespite all his (semi-)intellectual efforts, he is most proud of the certificate he obtained after succesfully completing a one day Formula 1 driving course at the Paul Ricard Circuit in France.\n\nGeert lives with his significant other and three daughters in The Hague, the global capital of Peace and Justice.",

Both have existed since 2015. The founders are all friends or family of people who have died of pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately there is little attention for pancreatic cancer. Presumably because most people die so quickly that there is no time and space to set up actions or ask for attention.\n\nThe Support Casper campaign is committed to providing financial support for the much-needed research and development of an effective treatment method by viro-immunotherapy. Casper has put together a team that includes virologists, pediatric oncologists and neurosurgeons from Erasmus MC, Leiden University Medical Center and UMC Utrecht. Together they want to work on methods that no longer focus on the disease, but on the strength of the patient and his ability to use his own body against the malignant tumor. They think it is possible!\n\nOur ambition is to be able to produce effective and affordable medicines for pancreatic cancer patients by 2030, so that they live longer and feel less sick."
