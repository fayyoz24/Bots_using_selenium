    "summary": "I am a Dutch artist, researcher and educator. My practice is situated in the field of ecological art and ecocriticism, with a specific interest in the topic of the influence of the technosphere on evolutionary processes and methods of attunement, particularly to matter and its situated and networked lives. My artistic practice is research-driven and finds its voice in developing and exhibiting artwork, writing, curating and developing education. For the past 4,5 years I have pioneered ecological art in the field of education, by founding and developing a new master's program \u201cEcology Futures\u201d at the Master Institute of Visual Cultures of Avans University of Applied Sciences, that puts the exploration and invention of artistic-scientific methods at the forefront of practicing ecocritical theory in the field, aiming to find new ways of (co)generating practice-led knowledge in the process. Ecology Futures is the first MA program about ecological art in the Netherlands, as well as the first MA art program in the Netherlands to center, facilitate and teach biotechnological methodologies in an interdisciplinary setting. The latter was developed from my position as a researcher in the affiliated Biobased Art&Design Research group (CARADT) and in the newly installed Material Incubator Lab & Project Space, both led by Dr. Elvin Karana. \n\nI am at my best when spearheading innovation, and get my energy from bringing together transdisciplinary teams and developing programs that may bring well-informed, surprising, and layered ecocritical narratives. Over the years I\u2019ve been involved with numerous institutions and initiatives, often leading to longstanding collaborations and multiple roles, such as with Common Ground (residency program curator followed by a public artwork commission), with FIBER Festival (residency/lab program curator, participating artist, education partner), with renowned design collective Dutch Invertuals (member and co-founder of Dutch Invertuals Academy), and with RAUM (co-curator/artistic advisor and curatorial manager of commissions). In my early career, I ran an agency for ecocritical designers, coaching and helping them develop their vision and business.",

The many patches of reefs are temporal, ephemeral, and alien, offer a sense of hope, and demonstrate resilience.\nWith Ghost Reef, Xandra van der Eijk attempts to plant the fantasy of a North Sea reef in the imagination. Animated video collages with 3D generated models based on the scarce footage taken by divers are juxtaposed with fieldrecording soundscapes taken at two locations: an oyster bank near the Brouwersdam in Zeeland, and the wreck of the Ara, a steamship that was sunk by a mine in 1942, located north of Schiermonnikoog.\n\nWith thousands of ship- and plane wrecks covering the North Sea floor, and thousands of other structures such as oil- and gas platforms and windmills serving as substrates, new underwater communities are continiously forming. Each community can exist due to its particular place in the sea and the conditions it is subjected to. In the vastness of murky water, colonized by humans, territories are lost, won, and expanded on. The structures themselves are time capsules that describe the process of colonization through its historical shipwrecks, its lost ammunition, its fishing gear, abandoned wells, and drilling platforms. Yet unseen to the human eye life unfolds. The anthropogenic structures are reclaimed by countless species; big and small. Each community is an ecosystem unique in its composition and has its own identity.\n\nGhost Reef was comissioned by Embassy of the North Sea\n& MU Hybrid Art House.\n\nProject partners\nWMR, NIOZ, Dutch Maritime Productions\n& Stichting Duik de Noordzee Schoon\n\n3D modeling\nSacha van den Haak\n\nSound design\nS\u00e9bastien Robert",

These life forms can be traced back millions of years, and are speculated to be the earliest forms of life on the planet. Their robustness and stability, even in environments as unforgiving as space, suggest they are likely the first sort of extraterrestrial life we expect to one day discover.\n\nBy sampling fluids from volcanic hot springs and high saline ponds during research trips to Iceland and France, I managed to isolate several strains that produce pigments. At the moment, I am conducting the next step in my research: attempting to master and influence the pigment production, eventually hoping to induce a full color change in the microbes. With Genesis, I am hacking the origin of life, ultimately questioning who is in control.",

In a four meter wide container an algae enriched base is the stage for pigments to perform. Slowly, drops fall from glass pipes, onto the surface, pushing one another away as they touch. The result is an ever changing drawing, striking much resemblance with growth rings or sedimentation. By placing the glass pipes in a subsequent position, the once beautiful drawing is gently forced aside for a new one, thus creating an every changing timeline.\n",

Everyone is welcome at RAUM to propose and carry out creative ideas, with innovative forms and connections as a result.

Our organization began as a Dutch Design summer school in 2012 and has grown to include a broad spectrum of year-round activities.\n\nIn a world of accelerated change where the future is increasingly uncertain, Open Set advocates for the growing critical role of design and visual culture. However, we reject the current view of design as a panacea for global challenges1. Our ambition is to re-complicate design\u2019s engagement with contemporary problems by opening up the conversation between different schools of thought, disciplines, and cultures.\nIf we are to re-define the roles and terms of design, we need environments that structurally facilitate experimentation and the \u2018unlearning\u2019 of professional conventions and expectations. The seed of this transformation in design thinking is the ethical position of an individual designer, situated in and committed to a specific time and place.",

Starting with advising, writing grant proposals and developing prototypes to products, right up to developing a platform to promote and sell their work. Through time, I developed a coaching structure of multiple sessions, in which my clients were challenged to decide upon their core business and structure their practices in service of their unique identity. The sessions were focussed on strategy, finance, marketing, communication, and sales - the latter in the broadest sense of the word. Being an artist or designer, finding a way to earn a living off your work is not easy. It demands a creative approach to business, and that is exactly what I invited my clients to work on. \n\nAmongst my longer-term clients were Kirstie van Noort, Alissa+Nienke, Aliki van der Kruijs and Studio Roos Meerman. Shorter-term clients include Handmade Industrials and Jetske Visser & Michiel Martens. \n\n\u2014\nI Wait Here highly values research-based, conceptual projects and products from emerging designers and artists working on the intersection of art, science and technology. By providing individual project support we create space for the designers and artists to make new work. I Wait Here primarily offers professional artistic coaching, business support, PR and project management. Day to day activities include writing grant proposals, analysing artistic work and advise on business choices. We aim to support our clients for a long time and by doing so, hope to make a valuable contribution to both their career and the field of design and art in general.",
