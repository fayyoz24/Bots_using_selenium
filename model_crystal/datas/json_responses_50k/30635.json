    "summary": "My managing R&D role at Concrefy focuses on:\n\n- 3D Concrete Printing\n- Construction Digitization and the Future of the Construction Industry\n- Smart Asset Management\n- Value Engineering Method\n- Sustainable Civil Infrastructure\n- Condition-based and Predictive Maintenance of Civil Infrastructure\n- Remote Sensing of Concrete Durability\n- Forensic Engineering\n\nProject Manager of the INTERREG project \"Asset Management 2.0\" (2016 - 2019)  - Decision Support Tool is developed for asset owners who would be able to ensure cost-effective proactive maintenance of infrastructure.\n\nPreviously, I was a researcher and completed a PhD at TU Delft, where my promotor was one of the leading experts in the world of concrete structures, Prof. dr. ir. J. C. Walraven.\n\nProposition:\nRegardless of how good you are at something, failures will always occur on your way to a lofty goal. Reaching that goal will not only depend on how good you are, but even more on your capacity to benefit from failures and persistently keep going along adjusted routes towards that goal.",

Joost Walraven\n\nSummary:\nThe service life of concrete structures can be significantly shortened when corrosion of steel reinforcement occurs, especially in a marine environment and in structures exposed to de-icing salts. The influence of load- or deformation-induced cracks on corrosion progress is an important issue which was studied in this research in relation to the durability and service life of reinforced concrete structures. An experimental set-up was designed in order to generate knowledge and contribute to existing codes and practice. \nThe influence of load- and deformation-induced cracks in future codes and regulations, should be limited by defining the maximum allowable steel stress in conjunction with bar diameter and concrete cover at a certain concrete strength under the maximum service load, in order to assure the desired service life of a concrete structure exposed to an aggressive environment.",
