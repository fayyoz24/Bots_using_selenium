    "summary": "Throughout my engineering career I have demonstrated an exceptional level of professionalism, which has gained the recognition of peers, management and clients alike. Reliability, focus and dedication to the tasks at hand, are underlined by the enthusiasm I take with me to work every day.\n\nHighly adaptable to the most dynamic and challenging working environments, I have gained a wealth of professional experience performing my duties with the aim of not only meeting expectations, but also the motivation and drive to exceed them. Key ingredients when dealing with time critical design projects within a variety of disciplines.\n\nDemonstrating a passion for excellent communication and cohesive teamwork at all levels, I have shown understanding, patience, sensitivity and responsibility both working within teams and leading them. I am equally comfortable working as a component of the greater machine, or leading by example as the engine driving and managing projects.\n\nAs I take the next steps of my professional career, I seek employment in challenging and rewarding environments where I can fully demonstrate my existing engineering experience and capabilities, with a desire to expand my knowledge and learn new skills, aimed at further enhancing the qualities I can offer to prospective employers and their clients.\n\nTo find out more, or to connect with me, please email me via famisibwana@gmail.com\n",
