    "summary": "Agnes Meershoek studied Health Care Sciences at Maastricht University and majored in Theory of Health Care Sciences, which focuses on sociological and philosophical analysis of institutionalisation of health care and health problems. She obtained her doctoral degree (PhD) in 1999 at the same University on a study on the functioning of disability arrangements in the Netherlands. The theme of her research program is Participation, Citizenship and Professionalism in Health care and work. Her research interests include: health and participation; inclusive society; workplace health. The main focus of her projects is the tension between policy intentions and policy outcomes, in particular the implicit normativity of professional practices and the consequences of arrangements in terms of citizens\u2019 and professionals\u2019 responsibility, solidarity and social exclusion. She applies social constructivist policy theory and science and technology studies\u2019 concepts to compare between regulations, practices and contexts on an international and global scale.  \nFor her research she works in close cooperation with governmental institutions on disability and work incapacity, client/patient organizations and professional organizations of insurance physicians, vocational experts etc.\nAgnes teaches in the Master of Science in Global Health. She is responsible for the modules developed and taught in collaboration with partner Universities In India (Manipal University) Canada (McMaster University), Thailand (Thammasat University) and Colombia (Rosario University) on policy analysis and project design. She coordinates the elective track Implementing innovations in Health Care and the module Globalization and Transferability.",
