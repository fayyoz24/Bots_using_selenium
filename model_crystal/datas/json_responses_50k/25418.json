    "summary": "I have a PhD in Computational Chemistry from Simon Fraser University, Canada. During my PhD, I worked on understanding mechanism of interfacial proton transport through a model system representing perfluorosulfonic acid polymer electrolyte membrane used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells using molecular modelling techniques. The work gave an interesting insight into the mechanism of proton transport and resulted in two first-authorship publications.\nI have also completed Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science. As a part of this curriculum, I completed courses in Transact SQL, Power BI, R, machine learning among others.\nI enjoy learning new things and am a fast learner. I am interested in the field of data analysis as it helps in extracting meaningful information and provides insights into it. ",
