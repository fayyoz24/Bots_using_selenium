    "summary": "Recently defended my PhD at the Institute of Research and Technology Saint Exup\u00e9ry in Toulouse, France. My thesis tackled the correlation between Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) and Operational Diagnosis (MBO), aiming to define a new type of model to be used for system health monitoring, to help operators perform diagnosis more efficiently.\n\nStakeholders involved in my research work: Airbus Defence & Space, LAAS-CNRS, ONERA, INSA Toulouse and ENSEEIHT/IRIT. Doctoral School: ED-AA (A\u00e9ronautique Astronautique, ISAE-SUPAERO). \n\nI also hold a Mechanical Engineering Diploma from the National Technical University of Athens and an Advanced Masters in Space Systems Engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO. \n\nMoreover I have a research experience in educational robotics, notably during the time I spent at the European Space Agency (ESA) in the Netherlands, where I participated in the launching of an experimental project in space orbital robotics, which aimed at raising students\u2019 interest and engagement in STEM subjects, while making physics lessons more interactive and fun. \n\nDuring my student years I was highly involved in the training and education activities of a student NGO called Board of European Students of Technology where I coordinated various events related to soft skills training and higher education matters, striving to contribute to the improvement of the quality of education in technical universities in Europe, by proposing new approaches to teaching STEM subjects at university level.\n\nI have delivered more than 100 hours of soft skills training to engineering students in all throughout Europe. I have also coached and mentored many younger volunteers and future trainers.\n\nRaising awareness about the importance of soft skills development in STEM education and STEM professions, as well as the encouragement of girls to be involved in STEM studies, remain some of the biggest goals of my post-doc career.",

EoEs increase technology students\u2019 awareness in educational issues by initiating discussions amongst them and the other stakeholders of education: the university and company representatives. \nThese representatives, participants at the EoE, are mostly important foreign experts in the field of EEE from various agencies & organisations and professors.\nThe outcomes of this event are gathered to a conclusive report and disseminated to the interested and related parties, and the educational scientific community through publications and attendance at international conferences, with the goal of improving the future engineering education of Europe."
