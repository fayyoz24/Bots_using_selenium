Often children from families with a migrant background are unable to develop their reading skills at home, as the parents themselves are not proficient in Dutch. Therefore, once a week a volunteer spends an hour reading with the children. As coordinator, I was responsible for 6 families and their volunteers. The task I had was to make sure that the match went well, and to monitor whether reading process went well and to support the volunteers in case there were problems. I organized meetings for my volunteers to exchange their experiences, as well as visiting the families on three occasions throughout the trajectory."
