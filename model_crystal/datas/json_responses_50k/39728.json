The organization has different projects and partners in the area and has as main objectives to increase schooling, empowerment and entrepreneurship and provide health education. As social worker, I joined the organization in their office, wrote and edited projects' proposals and helped fundraising. Moreover, as health educator I set up different activities with a local school on hygiene practices and disease prevention and with a \"Save the Children\" orphanage. In the orphanage, the activities were aimed especially for the teenagers and focused on sex and sexuality education, hygiene practices and learning how to take care of ourselves and respect each other.",
