Eurofor was formed in May 1995 in\u00a0Lisbon, and was answerable to the\u00a0Western European Union\u00a0(WEU) directly.\u00a0It was tasked with performing\u00a0Petersberg tasks, including\u00a0humanitarian,\u00a0peacekeeping\u00a0and\u00a0peace enforcement\u00a0missions. With the merger of several WEU elements into the\u00a0European Union, Eurofor had by and large become part of the\u00a0Common Security and Defence Policy. It was eventually transformed into an\u00a0EU Battlegroup\u00a0and was on standby from 1 July until 31 December 2011. On 2 July 2012, Eurofor was dissolved",
