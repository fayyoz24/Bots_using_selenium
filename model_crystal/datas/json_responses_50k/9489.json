    "summary": "Well-rested and nature-connected people can change the world. It is my passion and mission to help you or your team to reconnect with nature, with yourself and with others, via:\n\n*Forest Bathing and EcoNIDRA\u2122 sessions to relax and reconnect with nature, with yourself, with your team. In person (Netherlands) or remotely guided wherever you and your team are.\n\n*Nature-based Wellbeing Programs for teams & 1: 1 Mentoring to help you live less in your mind and more connected with your heart and body.\n\n*Certified EcoNIDRA\u2122 Teacher Training if you'd like to help others rest and reconnect with nature and with themselves.\n\n*Train the trainer: if you have an organization or training where you'd like to include the element of nature-based wellbeing.\n\n*Create a training: if you have a nature and/or human connection related project and would like to have an (online) training to offer to the broad public.\n\nMy work (in Dutch or in English) is based on reconnecting with nature, deep relaxation, slowing down, learning to listen to our body, to other people and to the rest of nature. It teaches us to be more present in our daily life, to practice kindness, and to remember the relationship between humans and the planet. \n\nThe techniques allow you or your team to take a step back to be able to make positive changes in the way you work, live or interact with others. They allow you to use the freed up vital energy to do what you were really born to do in this life. \n\nThe sessions and programs are popular among private persons, corporations, organizations, students, groups of friends and families alike.\n\nI've had the pleasure to be trained by world experts and great mentors in Forest Therapy, Yoga Nidra, Council Facilitation, as a Teacher of Presence, Wellbeing Inspired by Nature Consultant, Holistic Nutrition & Life Coach, in Wilderness First Aid, Cross-Cultural Communication and Linguistics, and have 20+ years\u00a0of experience with training adults and community building for nature and human connection based projects.\n\nContact me for more information or possibilities.
