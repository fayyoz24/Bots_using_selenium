    "summary": "I am an anthropologist with more than ten years of academic experience. I carried out transdisciplinary research, taught, and participated in several projects involving civil society and the university. My training in this area took place in the south of Brazil, at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, where I completed my master's and a doctorate in Social Anthropology. In addition, my degree in journalism allowed me to accumulate experience in using technologies for field work \u2013 actively participating in the Laboratory of Visual Anthropology and Image Studies, where I perfected my research with the historical and archival method and the use of images. In 2018 I came to Amsterdam for the first time as an External Doctorate candidate in the Social and Cultural Anthropology department. In 2021, I returned to the same department as a visiting researcher. My current research focuses on the circular economy, waste, and eco-social innovation in urban waters. Since then, I have dedicated myself to studying Dutch society and its relationship with solid waste. As a result, I am becoming a specialist in socio-environmental development and circular economy. In addition, I have accumulated knowledge and experience with discussions on sustainability inside and outside academia, both in Brazil and the Netherlands.",
