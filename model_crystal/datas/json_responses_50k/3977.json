Our team was tasked with finding a solution that provided a solid defense for the network. As the project leader, I made critical decisions and delegated tasks to ensure smooth execution and timely completion. We followed an agile methodology, tested various traffic filtering methods, conducted penetration tests, and developed a disaster recovery plan.\n\nAfter extensive testing and refinements, we successfully delivered a solution that met the client's needs. They were satisfied with the outcome, and the project was completed on time and within budget. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project, and I'm proud to have been a part of the team that delivered it.\n\nTechnologies had been used in this project:\n IDS/IPS\n PfSense\n Python (for the testing purposes)\n Nagios XI",
