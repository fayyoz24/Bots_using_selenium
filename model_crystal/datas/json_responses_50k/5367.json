    "summary": "Delivering sustainable growth by creative and data-inspired marketing \n\nI'm an ambitious and result-driven marketing leader with a broad skill-set spanning many facets of B2B and B2C marketing. I have extensive experience leading and scaling marketing teams in fast-growing and complex environments, including global organisations and working cross-functionally with geographically disparate teams. I have been responsible for market-leading brands, events and marketing programs across global and local industries such as media, tech, automotive, pharmaceuticals, finance and more.\n\nMy colleagues would describe me as a strong communicator and relationship builder with internal and external stakeholders at all levels. I like to use my right-brain creativity and left-brain analytical sense to bring innovation, commercial acumen and customer focus to the identification of new services, revenue streams, partnerships and innovative marketing campaigns with clear business results. \n\nI\u2019ve been able to develop my leadership skills through different leadership programmes, such as LeasePlan\u2019s Talent Development Programme, UBM Live\u2019s International Exchange in New York and Dubai and the One Young World Summit in South Africa. I hold a Master degree in Business (Griffith University, Australia) and a Bachelor degree in Marketing (Business School of Amsterdam).\n\nIn my free time I like to challenge myself through individual- and team sports, such as running marathons and joining triathlons. I also enjoy exploring the world by traveling and photography.",
