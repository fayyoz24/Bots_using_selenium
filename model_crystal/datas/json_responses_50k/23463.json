    "summary": "I have worked in education sector for over 24 years. After fulfilling my passion for teaching mathematics in initial years of my career, I switched over my role to management and administration which are in line with my inherent qualities and something that I aimed at.\n\nI had always loved to lead a team whether it was as a President of the Student Council during my college days or in my job for past 15 years.  My interpersonal skills, organisational capabilities, positive attitude and problem solving competencies resulted in best teams with great results.\n\nExperience gave me in-depth understanding of processes within an organisation and an insight to crease out problem areas, make systems better, create Standard Operating Procedures for various functions. \n\nThroughout my career I have enjoyed taking up challenges by acquiring new roles. My belief in endless learning helped me to enrich my experience and helped in the taking the processes to the next level by bringing in more transparency and a systematic approach.  \n\nI am never out of work, because I generate work for myself else I work on myself.\n\nMy capabilities:\n\nRecruitment, Process Improvement, Planning & Implementation, Scheduling, Team Building, Resource Management, Preparation of Instructional Manuals, Learning & Development \n",
