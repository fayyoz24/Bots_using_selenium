    "summary": "As a soulful business coach, I specialize in helping executives and their organizations reach their full potential by increasing their consciousness and leadership skills. I work closely with top leaders to help them become more self-aware, empathetic and compassionate leaders. \n\nI'm a sales & marketing pro with over a decade of experience under my belt, and I've worked in a variety of industries all over the world. \n\nWe're all here to grow our consciousness, and I believe business can be a powerful tool for creating positive change in the world and reducing suffering for all beings. \nI've had the privilege of living and working in some amazing places like Curacao, Nepal, Dubai, and Peru, which has given me a unique perspective and understanding of different cultures.\n\nThrough coaching, consulting, courses, and workshops, I help people tap into their inner wisdom, empower them to be their authentic selves, and guide them to execute on it with soulful strategies and aligned action, to create a life that not only looks good from the outside but also feels good from the inside, without the worry, stress, and emptiness.\u201d\n\nIn addition to my coaching skills, I'm also a breath-work instructor and yoga teacher. I bring a holistic approach to my work, and I'm known for my compassionate nature, sharp mind, and passionate drive to help others succeed in meaningful ways.\n\nI know how hard it can be to juggle everything and get caught up in the day-to-day grind and I want to help executives achieve balance and fulfilment in both their personal and professional lives. I incorporate mindfulness, yoga, and breath-work techniques to help reduce stress, enhance focus, and improve overall well-being.\n\nSo if you're an executive looking to take your leadership skills and business to the next level and create a more positive and productive work culture, let's connect. I'm excited to work with you and help you achieve your goals, and become the best version of yourself!\n\nLink to website:\nhttps://www.soulfulsolutions.co\n\nLinkTree:\nhttps://linktr.ee/jordyjaarsma",

I have been fortunate that in this way I met a lot of companies in a relatively short time and talked about their future plans. Because I have spoken to so many different companies, I have also got a good picture of the country, the culture, and its people. And one thing I can say with certainty 'It is a great country with beautiful people'. One to Watch describes in its mission that they build successful businesses in Nepal. Together with Nepalese entrepreneurs and Impact investors, they make a social impact. I am truly grateful that I have been able to contribute a small part to this cause.",
