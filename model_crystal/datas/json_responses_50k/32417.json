    "summary": "I am a Learning and Development Manager at TomTom, a global leader in navigation and location technology. With over 18 years of experience in L&D, I have developed a core expertise in learning strategy, platforms, and design, as well as the delivery of learning experiences at scale, using the appropriate technology and tools as enablers.\n\nMy passion is to help organizations transition from a training approach to a performance support mindset, where the focus of learning is less on knowledge acquisition and more on skills application and continuous improvement. I do this by embedding learning in the flow of work, co-creating impactful learning programs, and helping teams and organizations develop the ultimate competitive advantage- a learning culture. \n\nI have worked across a range of sectors including publishing, online education, e-commerce, and ed-tech, and multiple geographies including the UK, US, India and Netherlands. I hold a MA in Creative and Media Writing and multiple certifications in learning-related topics. \n\nLooking forward to connecting and learning together!",
