    "summary": "Computer Science Student at Radboud University with a focus on data, security, and innovation. \n\nCurrently I am residing in Nanyang Technological University in Singapore for a study exchange. Afterward, I will complete my Honours bachelor thesis here as well.\n\nDuring the second and third years if my study in Computing Science, I am partaking in the Radboud Honours Academy. During the first year of this program, together with other motivated students, we researched into the early diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis. We presented this research to professors and experts at ETH Zurich and Radboud University.\n\nIn my free time outside of university I have been involved members in my study association, the badminton sporting accusation, and the theatre cultural association. Here I lead the writing of a murder mystery, helped select teachers and lead the writing of a 16 page murder mystery.\n\nFor my end-project at secondary education, I participated in a project at NXP Semiconductors where I investigated patterns in semi-structured data and designed and developed a Python program to generate an Excel sheet based on this data.\n\nAfter this project, I build a website for the \"Gouden Draak\"-foundation (http://www.goudendraak.com), incorporating functional and non-functional requests from stakeholders. \n\nFurthermore, during my secondary education, I have had a total of three different week-long internships at Wiwi Websolutions, where I got mentored by professional web designers.\n\nDuring these projects I have worked with several programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.\n\nI am aspiring to become a professional pentester (e.a. ethical hacker), both physically and through networks.",
