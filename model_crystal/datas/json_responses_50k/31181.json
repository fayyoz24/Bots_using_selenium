While some businesses easily connect to the concept of Social Media and Social Networks, others struggle to understand its use, its value, and its implementation. Our aim was to investigate how good or bad practice impacts the consumer mindset. \n\nThis thesis provides a deeper understanding of the motivations for users to engage with business fanpages, what it is that makes them engage and more importantly how this forms their perceptions, either leading to a successful relationship... or a painful exit.\n\nWith the use of a quantitative study we collected consumer data focusing on three points in a Facebook fanpage relationship: (1) active brand-relationship (\"Like\"), (2) unsubscribed from brand-relationship (\"Hide\"), and (3) exited brand-relationship (\"Unlike\"). Evaluating how the motivations to engage with a brand on Facebook correspond with the actions performed by the brand resulted in the measurement of its discrepancy, or \"gap\". It was recognized that the gap was considerably larger for consumers who decided to \"hide\" brand content or decided to exit the brand relationship. On the basis of this data, we zoom into each group and investigate on the perceived value of the firm-created content, the interaction with the brand, and finally the perceptions towards the brand itself. \n\nThe results of this study show the sad truth: if a brand embarks on Social Media without understanding its target group and their motivations to enter into a social relationship, the brand-perceptions established is likely to suffer. \n\nThe knowledge of this study provides insight into the form of communication desired in a brand-relationship on Facebook, and which is rejected. This leads the way to more effective social media strategies in which the value of the brand is protected.\n\n",

Moreover, secondary and primary market research was conducted to gain an inside-out as well as an outside-in perspective. The primary market research consisted of an employee and a client survey to obtain opinions and impressions of the status quo. The combination of the interviews with the CEO and the primary and secondary research, helped to discover an holistic picture of the agency's competitive situation, including its strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and threats. Based on the analysis of the past and present of the agency as well as the current and predicted future market situation, a detailed strategic development programme was completed.\n\nIn a final presentation our team illustrated future potentials, business and corporate strategies to remain competitive in the market, to tap into new markets, and to achieve sustainable growth.
