Several user research methods where used as a basis of our research including interviews, brainstorm sessions, storyboards, focus groups, and concept validation. In the end we defined requirements to which extensions to the existing DirectLife web service should adhere. Our results show that adding several extensions to the DirectLife web service that increase social interaction can enhance both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.",

The concept is a unique combination of dynamic light, sound and projection with the aim to reduce clients\u2019 stress and anxiety levels by supporting and involving them in their own care program. An important complement to the system is the staff UI which allows the caregiver to control the functionalities and settings of the each of the sensory rooms for acute psychiatric wards. This allows the staff to tailor settings of the room to the personal needs and psychosis level of clients. \n\nThe learning\u2019s from the user interface tests were taken into account and implemented in the concept at the GGzE crisis unit in Eindhoven. We believe that the design and functionalities of the system has shown to be very well tailored to the needs of the psychiatric patients and staff working at mental healthcare institute. From April- October 2013 the system was used in a validation study in which we investigated the patient and staff experience, and the usage of the system.",
