But I was amazed to see something else emerge: the governments of other European countries were also making decisions to \"help\" Greece for the people and despite their own people's opinions. I showed the students a short Greek documentary that focused on shaking down the presumption a lot jump into: that the Northern European countries are seen as  the industrious \"ants\" whereas  the Mediterranean Greeks as the care-free \"grasshoppers\" .   This helped the students realize that there are no bad or good nationalities and that we should not draw conclusions based on single perspectives.",

In particular I taught WVO and HAVO students at the Reviuslyceum and VMBO and MBO students at the LIFE College in Rotterdam Area. Both schools belong to the the Lentiz Onderwijsgroep in The Netherlands. Some lessons were remendial, some obviously exam oriented but others gave me the liberty to experiment while also tutoring some groups of students. Furthermore, I participated in various excursions, trips, conferences and projects of the school, such as in the European Education classroom and the Sociology and the Philosophy classroom. I did not only teach but was also being taught through every single student I interacted with.",
