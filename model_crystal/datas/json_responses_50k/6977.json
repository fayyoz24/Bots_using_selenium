The ETP Wijster is looking for an innovative business model where flexibility becomes the new source of value creation. In this study we have designed and validated a flexible, multi-commodity business model that allows Attero\u2019s waste incineration plant and the industries at the ETP Wijster to harness the flexibility embedded in their industrial processes and successfully commercialise it. The source of flexibility in the model is the integration of heat and electricity grids in an intelligent manner. Instead of producing heat and electricity in fixed amounts, the production of these commodities becomes variable, depending on the electricity market prices (including day-ahead, intraday and imbalance markets) and the availability of flexibility among the industries. The industries trade their flexibility on an internal trade platform with Attero who in turn exploits the flexibility on the electricity market. This business model is validated with the help of techno-economic model that calculates potential profits. The results show that the business model is viable.",

The changes render the traditional business models of the energy enterprises obsolete. Consequently, energy enterprises need to explore new business models that are viable to ensure their success and long term survival.\n\nMy research over the past five years has focused on answering the following research question, \u201cHow to develop a validated framework for designing and evaluating viable business models for energy enterprises in a business ecosystem?\u201d\n\nTo address the above question, I have developed a framework and successfully applied it to design and evaluate viable business models for two firms. The first firm is a local company that sets up and operates solar farms on behalf of local energy initiatives and has also implemented the business model. The second firm is an energy provider that owns and operates multi-commodity energy systems (heat and electricity) at several industrial sites and wants to transition to a business model where flexibility becomes the key value driver.  The energy provider is in the process of assessing their capabilities to implement the business model.",
