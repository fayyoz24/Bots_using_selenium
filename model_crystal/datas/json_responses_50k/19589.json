He pretends to speak with spirits to obtain his client's money. Gabriel doesn't believe in God or spirituality and is mainly focused on making money. One night he has a violent nightmare of a Christ like figure being crucified. As he awakens he discovers a wound on his stomach. In the hospital he meets father Nolan, a priest who offers him help. Gabriel, a non believer, rejects the proposition. That night he is visited by Olympia, a woman who just heard that she is infertile. At first Gabriel doesn't want to help her. She offers him $400 and he caves in. Gabriel tries to use trickery to convince Olympia he has magic powers, but mysteriously none of the gags are working. For the first time he emerges himself into meditation. He receives a violent vision in which he sees an ultrasound of a baby as well as the dead body of Olympia. Gabriel decides not to share this revelation with Olympia. During the night he receives another nightmare vision and wakes up with stigmata on his wrists. He researches this occurrence on the internet and finally decides to meet with father Nolan to get the advise of a specialist. Father Nolan questions the trustworthiness of Gabriel's story. 33 days later Gabriel's wounds seem to heal. He is visited however by Olympia who is pregnant now. Gabriel realizes his visions are coming true and his life is about to change dramatically.",
