This test was developed by Harvard and redesigned by Critical Mass to be used in the Netherlands. The presentation is suitable for groups from 15 to 500 people. It adds a dynamic content experience in meetings, conferences and events.\n- supported the Municipality of Utrecht at their Human Rights Coalition cafe with a method that allows professionals to understand which societal trends and developments influence their work and allows them to find which issues need to be worked on.\n- advised start-ups and social entrepreneurs that wish to enter the market in Dutch municipalities\n- worked with Eyeopenerworks in their program for young changemakers that wish to have an impact for a more sustainable world (coached a program for fairtrade municipalities)\n- developed a project with my wife called Bij-Leren - where people can share their knowledge from home by inviting people at their dinner table - and allowing people that do not have access to learning and development to find it at their doorstep.",
