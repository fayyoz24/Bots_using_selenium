Along with my 25 years of HR experience, this program has enabled me to reposition my point of view to an international context influenced by the advent of the latest issues facing society today.\nAs a trained legal professional, I\u2019ve held various director positions in labour organizations representing members of the Canadian public service. As a member of the management team, I developed expert level skills in negotiating and lobbying, acting as labour union spokesperson while dealing \u00a0directly with high-ranking government officials. An accomplished communicator and mobilizer, I\u2019ve headed cross-functional teams in the execution of various projects.",
