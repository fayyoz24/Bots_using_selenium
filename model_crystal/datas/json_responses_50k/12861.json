    "summary": "With ACT I help my clients to build a life in line with what really matters to them, their values. I aim to preach what I practice. My most important values \u200b\u200bare freedom, connection and peace. Traveling for me is the ultimate feeling of freedom. I grow by stepping out of my comfort zone. In my work this is translated to the freedom to keep learning and to meet new clients. The connection I experience dancing with my dance partner and the music I also experience working with my clients and colleagues. I feel peace when I walk in nature, meditate, and do yoga. Being grounded within myself is an important foundation of my work.",
