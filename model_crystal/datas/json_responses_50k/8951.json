    "summary": "After graduation from high school, I was enrolled at Certified General Accountant in the International School of Jinan University in September 2010, to prepare for the actualization of my dream. Frankly speaking, through 4-year courses learning, I have built my comprehensive framework of accounting and have been awarded academic scholarship each year. All of the courses are instructed in English. \n\nNever restrict to the theories study, I zealously participate in various practices in campus and off campus so as to expand my horizon and enhance my comprehensive capacities including management, cooperation. I took charge of the leader position in various organizations, having strengthened my sense of responsibility and fostered the analytical, problem-solving, managerial skills, which I suppose are significant to engage in accounting or finance work. Moreover, I seize opportunities to intern in company, to touch real business issues so as to equip myself with profession ability.",
