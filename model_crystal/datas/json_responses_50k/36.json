I was the team leader of a group of young students hitting social entrepreneurship \nfor the first time. We chose the drowning of sea workers as our social challenge. So, we came up with \na new concept of a life saver equipped with a GPS to track lost workers. Actually, this product is very \nunique as it is very light and can be easily worn while working. So if an accident happens, the sea \nworkers will be protected and easily rescued. Our team has participated in INJAZ Tunisia\u2019 nationwide \ncompetition and won the innovation prize. My contribution in this project was a unique experience as I\nwas the team leader of this young initiative. I believe I acquired leadership and teamwork skills. I also \nlearned how to pitch in front of an important audience. Although the social challenge we targeted was \nvery strenuous, our contribution was very effective. During this experience,I discovered my \nmanagement skills which led to achieve our common goal.  I have definitely became more eager to learn how to become a successful leader contributing in my country\u2019s development."
