    "summary": "My name is Oktay Aspalis and I am 23 years old.\nSince August 2022 I have graduated from my bachelor's degree in horticulture and arable farming at the Aeres Hogeschool in Dronten.\nI was born in the Netherlands but grew up in Greece.\nAfter my studies I want to go back to Greece to start my own company. Preferably a company in the agricultural or research sector. With the study that I am now following, I hope to gain sufficient knowledge in the field of horticulture and arable farming. I want to use this knowledge for my future company and to give advice to other companies.",

This served as part of my thesis. I also analyzed the changes brought by the new fertilizer legislation on organic substances and made an overview of the measured values. Finally, for my minor, I researched the experiences of Fertilab's customers when using the company's website. This resulted in an advice on how the company can develop its website.",
