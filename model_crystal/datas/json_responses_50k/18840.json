Saline water such as brackish water and sea water are considered as potential sources of water. Desalination is one of the most commonly used technique for water purification, but it is energy intensive. Therefore, there is a pressing and urgent need to develop new, less energy-intensive and efficient technologies for water desalination. The Microbial Desalination Cells (MDC) technology is a new sustainable approach that hold promising potential energy-efficacy for desalinating saline water. This is achieved through utilizing the organic matter and the microbial extracellular respiration activity in the waste water to produce energy to drive desalination. \nThe exoelectrogenic bacteria present in the waste water is used to induce an electric potential gradient across the anode and cathode chambers, which desalinates water by moving charges through several continuous ion exchange membranes. In the current study we review and investigate the several factors that affect the amount of wastewater required to desalinate the saline water, for instance, the Microbial desalination cells structure, way of transport, and pH. \n",

The beads were lyophilized to maintain a high surface area. Then, iron metal ion uptake study was conducted on a standard solution of FeCl3.6H2O and the underground water from the Baharyia Oasis. The formulation with the most synergistic effect was determined, based on the UV-Vis data. Moreover, the beads\u2019 Size, Swelling Extent were measured. Surface morphology was investigated using the Scanning Electron Microscope and the Stereo Microscope. Added to that, differential scanning calorimetry and FTIR and UV-Vis spectrophotometry were used to investigate the structure. \n",
