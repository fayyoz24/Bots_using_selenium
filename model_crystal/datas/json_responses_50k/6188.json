By using the Enron email corpus the knowledge transfer network within Enron\u2019s organization is plotted before and after the company\u2019s accounting scandal in 2001. The knowledge transfers are divided into explicit and tacit knowledge by using the concept of strength of ties from the field of social network analysis. An ordinary least square regression and a difference in difference regression demonstrate the change in the absolute level of knowledge transfers and the absolute amount of strong and weak ties from before to during the Enron scandal. The result shows that there is a significant increase in the absolute level of knowledge transfers of approximately 576 new knowledge transfers from before to during the scandal at Enron. Additionally, there is a significant increase in the amount of strong and weak ties, respectively, from before to during the scandal. Another discovery conclude that the percentage of strong ties, relative to the absolute amount of ties, decreased significantly. Controversy, the percentage of weak ties significantly increased. Shedding a light on the implication of a scandal on knowledge transfers within an organisational network fills a previously unexplored gap in the literature on knowledge transfer and bring relevant findings for scholars and practitioners.",

The focus of the study was the deregulation of the Swedish Health Care sector, which followed a political goal of increased deregulations in order to increase the \ncompetitiveness and thus reach a higher effectiveness within different sectors. \n\nThe study used a deductive method in order to complete four case studies with semi-structured interviews. Collected data were analysed through transcription and color-codes, and were presented through a short story. The result of the study pointed out how the entry- and growth barriers within the sector had change due to the deregulation, and determined which barriers that had to be overcome in order to enter the health care market  and reach a competitive growth.",
