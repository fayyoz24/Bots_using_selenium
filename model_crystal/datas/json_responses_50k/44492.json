    "summary": "Element15 is founded by Ingmar Barendregt, who has built the company since 2017. Over the years, Element15 has been performing extensive research and tests to progressively optimize the design and functionality of its water filtration system \u2018BAR\u2019. His background in Aerospace Engineering from the ETH Z\u00fcrich has strongly helped him in this process.\n\nAt the end of December 2022, Ingmar quitted his job as manager of a consulting firm to fully focus on Element15: \n\n\u201cWorking on technical challenges has always been my passion. Over the last couple of years, I realized that using my technical expertise to help people in stressful situations, gives a great amount of fulfillment in my live. Especially the demonstration of BAR in Namibia in 2022 was a tremendously exciting experience and made me decide to quit my job to fully dedicate myself to Element15.\n\nIn the upcoming period, I will do everything in my power to provide more and more people with BARs and, doing so, securing a sustainable supply of safe and affordable drinking water for them. Ultimately my goal is to grow Element15 into a multidisciplinary humanitarian engineering company that helps to tackle todays and tomorrow's challenges. In simpler wording: I want to become The Thunderbirds of humanitarian engineering.\u201d\n\nIngmar Barendregt\nFounder Element15",

This system, called BAR, characterizes itself by a high flow rate, around 600 liters per hour, and the fact that it does not only removes parasites and bacteria, but also heavy metals and viruses. BAR can be fixed installed in a household, however it can also be worn as a backpack, which makes it ideal for rural areas and emergency aid as well.",
