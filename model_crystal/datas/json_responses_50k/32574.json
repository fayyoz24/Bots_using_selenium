This project aimed to utilise the most popular social media platform for our generation- Instagram- and harbour positivity in an environment plagued with negativity. I started with acting as an anonymous channel for people to say nice things about their peers and publicly displayed them. The account swiftly moved onto sharing youth friendly mental health resources and advice form professionals in the field. Soon I was conducting weekly checkins consulting the school counsellor, and the project bloomed from something within my grade into a school wide phenomenon. Positive feedback from peers (anonymously) confirmed that it did in fact create a meaningful impact for the students of Indus International School, Bangalore, in the time period where I ran it.",
