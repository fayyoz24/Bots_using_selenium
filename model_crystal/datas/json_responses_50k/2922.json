So far, drilling stock material was stored with approximately 10 external suppliers'. Administratively, this stock was followed' by an excel spreadsheet. With annual drilling campaigns the need arose to have Dana's own warehouse to store all drilling stock material and with that, the necessity arose to implement a full, proper stock management system and procedure. It was decided to implement the Maximo stock module for this purpose and implement a Stock Business Unit in SunSystems. This project started in January 2012 and was initially lead by the Supply Chain Department. August 2012 it was \u2018taken over\u2019 by my self and executed in cooperation with Supply Chain Management, the Well Engineering & Construction Department and a C&A Joint Venture Accountant. The project was fully live in the course of 2013, including a full internal control procedure for this process.",

Quite some efficiency was gained because invoices can be retrieved very quickly because they are scanned and stored digitally in a very recognizable way. Furthermore, because necessary approval - before invoices can be paid, is made possible by a work flow mechanism throughout the whole organization. The project started May 2012 and went live September 2012. By December 2012 this new way of working was fully embedded in the organization.",
