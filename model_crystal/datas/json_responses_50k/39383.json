Human resource development is a key enabler for making transport and port infrastructure more efficient and to be able to develop sustainable economic clusters where companies can innovate. It seems that investments in such vital physical and knowledge infrastructure are not developed in synchronisation and approached from different viewpoints and with involvement of different stakeholders. As a result, port development stagnate, economic development is hampered and countries waste enourmous amounts of resources, both financial as well as human capital. I am interested in this field, particularly to better understand the process of port infrastructure and to provide a holistic view on synchronised development with the right partners on board at the right time in the development process.",

The researchers witnessed a acceleration of technological developments which causes a lot of dynamics. Particularly DevOps innovation teams accelerate the time-to market. The maritime labour market is highly international and technology driven. Craftsmanship is still paramount, but having the right cross-over skills enables talent to make real impact in innovation teams. There are numerous initiatives to find, attract, retain and grow maritime talent. Education, business and intermediaries are in close contact with each other. More diversity and talent targeting will lead to a larger talent pool, more influx from a more diverse background as well as allow professionals to make the cross-over to the maritime sector.",

Ports all over the world face similar challenges. When it comes to the Next Generation, we are all part of this Next Generation port citizens. We are all part of the problem \u00e0nd the solution. But there is no one size fits all. Each pair of city and port has an own identity. Where one port owes its size and position to favorable deep water, the other is situated downstream in a river delta, while another port may be protected by a coral reef. In port-cities we need to strive for sustainable value added, for the communities ports are embedded in. We have to mobilize port citizens from the bottom-up, make them part of this living city, and learn them how to adapt to ever faster changes. In the Next Generation Port-City existing and arriving citizens will find a sense of place. For them to make a contribution we have to nurture our port-city cultures. More of his conclusions can be found on the AIVP World Port City Conference website.",

In order to become qualified as a master, development of skills is equally important as development of knowledge. The objectives of a case driven method of learning is to develop new knowledge, apply knowledge, make informed judgements, as well to improve communication skills. As the case study work is spread out over a longer period of time, students have sufficient time to reflect and improve based on feedback. In other words, a case driven approach will prepare student for a steering their own learning process. The following case studies are developed: port internationalisation case, hinterland strategy case, hinterland modal shift case, port operations case, terminal management case.",

By means of a digital game, the game developers have initially decoupled port development and management concepts from its context, thereby taking a conceptual perspective on port development and management. The second stage of development was to define archetypes of ports, basic port functions as well as provide an overview of port dilemmas. The map editor allows configuration to any port dilemma in any port location.  Development team consisted of experts from Port of Rotterdam, TU Delft, STC Group, UNESCO-IHE and INTHERE.
