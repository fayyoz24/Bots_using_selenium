Agriculture is limited to some valleys next to rivers, mostly during the rainy season. Enhancing food-security by enabling year-round farming requires pumping water from the river. However, common available solutions such as diesel pumps are too costly for smallholder farmers on islands. Barsha pumps are hydro-powered pumps, not using any fuel or electricity, so operating costs are zero. The demonstration of two Barsha pumps in 2015 raised interest among smallholder farmers. There is willingness to pay, however the upfront costs of the pump are too high to be covered from savings, especially for women with aspiration to become commercial farmers as their husbands migrate to find jobs in other islands. This applied research addresses this barrier by piloting the Pay-per-harvest irrigation service and studying risks and barriers that must be addressed to scale the model to empower other smallholders, especially women.\n\nThe objective of the research is to establish a financing mechanism that would help in creating access to environmentally friendly irrigation technology to small-holder farmers, to enable year-round farming, which will enhance income level and food and nutrition security of the people, without damaging the environment. Furthermore, the research stresses on developing suitable financing mechanisms which enable farmers to pay for the solution, rather than giving away the technologies for free.\n\nThe overarching research question of this project is: Does the \u2018pay-per-harvest\u2019 model increase \u2018willingness to pay\u2019 and \u2018ability to pay\u2019 for the Barsha pump?",
