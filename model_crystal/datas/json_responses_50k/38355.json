    "summary": "Deel helps thousands of companies expand globally with unmatched speed and flexibility. It's global hiring, HR and payroll in just one system.\n\nBacked by Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz & Spark Capital.\n\n\nHaving an empirical background in corporate innovation through Uppsala University's Msc programme in Entrepreneurship, I am very enthusiastic about disruptive corporate innovation. This has let me to join LinkedIn, to help companies reach their growth plans and take the next step in the digital and social world. And move to Slack in order to get the most out of their people's potential in a more WFH - digital world. This led me to combine both - allowing talent to be hired anywhere and do their best work. \n\nIf you're curious to learn more about Deel and how Deel could benefit your organization, feel free to email me at robert.vinke@deel.com",
