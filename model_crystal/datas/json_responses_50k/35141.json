    "summary": "Merging Eastern and Western values and strengths, I'm a seasoned business mentor, business builder and entrepreneur championing 'Little Pivots' - the power of subtle shifts to drive big changes. Spreading my roots in Europe, Africa, and Asia, I guide growth-hungry startups and scale-ups, leveraging two decades of expertise in technology, media, entertainment, consumer lifestyle goods, oil & gas and more.\n\nMy clientele spans from budding startup and scale-ups , serious solo-preneurs to investors, and government bodies. As Rockstart Accelerator's first female CEO in 2012 and an ASEAN Rice Bowl Start-Up Awards juror from 2016-2018, I've always been an active player in the startup and scale-up ecosystem.\n\nInspired by ancient philosophies, modern psychology and life experiences, I write on resilience, gifting lessons and tools to spur change for the greater good. \n\nI'm driven to boost business growth by pinpointing obstacles, crafting solutions, and plotting realistic plans. With resilience and 'Little Pivots', I believe leaders can act boldly and remain authentic.\n\nA Malaysian world-citizen speaking five languages, I now call Amsterdam home alongside my French husband and two daughters.",
