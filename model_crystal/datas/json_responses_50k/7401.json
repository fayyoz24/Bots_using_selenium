    "summary": "Over twenty years professional experience in the field of strategy setting, campaigning, coordination and investigations. After four years of undertaking environmental due diligence and impact assessments across different industries, I directed my career towards my life-long passion and commitment to protect the world's oceans. \n\nFor 11 eleven years I held the position of Senior Ocean Campaigner with Greenpeace working on different campaigns around the world on land and at sea. Some highlights include: Developing a Greenpeace presence in West Africa, recruiting and mentoring staff and developing strategies for the region; Stopping the transfer of a highly destructive fishery (hydraulic dredging) from the Netherlands to Mauritania; Exposing fish crimes (IUU) around the world;  Leading Greenpeace\u2019s initial engagement on slavery and labour abuse in the fishing sector including presenting at INTERPOL's 2014 conference on human trafficking - the first time human trafficking and labour abuse at sea was discussed at such a forum. In my current capacity, I am campaigning, together with hundreds of scientists, civil society groups and businesses for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, a reckless emerging industry that will cause irreversible harm to deep-sea ecosystems, and for which the consequences in terms of disturbing locked-away carbon are unknown.\n\nSocial injustice and environmental crimes are inherently linked. Humanity is plagued by many woes including greed, terrorism, war, rape, lack of respect for nature and so much more. In order to turn the tide and achieve true harmony across cultures, race and religion as well as with our environment we must rediscover our place in the natural world and restore the balance of gender and equality through education and empowerment. \n\nIn 2017, I established a platform with nonprofit status called Women4Oceans which connects and supports women working for healthy oceans. Learn more at women4oceans.org. Follow W4O on Twitter, Instagram & LinkedIn: @Women4Oceans and find us on facebook.\n\nI continue to explore new ways to contribute to a better world. I am available for short-term assignments including public speaking. See my speaker profile.\n\nNew book out now: The Ocean and Us (theoceanandus.com). This book explores all the ways our lives interact with the ocean and what we can all do to improve ocean health. It brings together the expertise of over 30 ocean specialists from around the world.\n\nfarahobaidullah.com",
