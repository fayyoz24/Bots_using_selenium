Both maternal and paternal interactions are of interest in this study, as both are crucial to child development. Project CTARS features a joint-collaboration between the University of Maryland and East China Normal University. \n\nFamilies are observed in their home context regularly and the CSTARS team works to interpret, perform coding & analysis, as well as recruit additional study participants. Ultimately, CSTARS aims to contribute to the pool of cross-cultural developmental psychology knowledge and propose mitigation and intervention strategies for improving interactions between those of Asian and American cultures.",
