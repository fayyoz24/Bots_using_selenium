Teaching students the skills to use that knowledge to model climate changes on earth of varying temporal resolution (and it's effects on sea level). Further emphasis is put upon developing the students ability to identify and model causal relationships on a abstract level to create functional dynamic models. \n\n- World Food and Ecosystems:\nThis course aims to explain how biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic processes influence patterns in ecosystems and food production systems, how they have evolved in the past and how they might evolve in the future. Students are taught to analyze patterns/processes and their interactions determining world food and ecosystems using large spatial datasets with coding concepts (R, Google Earth Engine) seen during the tutorials to new problems on the nexus of food-and ecosystems.\n\nResponsibilities:\n- Explaining computational and physics assignments. \n- Providing instructions. \n- Answering questions on lecture material and individual assignments.\n- Reviewing assignments/exams.",

The goal is to make an experience of untouched nature more accessible, ultimately aiming to elicit an intrinsic motivation to protect nature and to make the first steps towards digitally conserving our planet's most diverse ecosystems in a pristine state for future generations. We aim to do so with the production of an interactive 360\u00b0 VR-experience based on real-world objects captured with 3D-scanning, an effort which is part of a larger vision encompassing scientific studies to understand these ecosystems and the development of documentaries to shine a light upon the people who depend on these ecosystems.\n\nDuring my internship I have put together a team to develop Ecogenesis VR. In that time we have written a production plan, made a budget, were one of the finalists for the WWF Student INNO challenge, applied for several academic and artistic funds and built up a network in the creative VR industry. In addition to writing a scientific report on the possible benefits of using VR in science communication, with a particular focus on conservation science. \n\nResponsibilities:\n\u2022 3D modelling of remote and in situ sensing data. \n\u2022 Coding in UnrealEngine4\n\u2022 Development of Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for Virtual Reality (VR)\n\u2022 Project management\n\u2022 Talent Acquisition\n\u2022 Fundraising\n\u2022 Academic reporting",

This project contributes to halting the decline of the coral reefs in the Caribbean Netherlands, improving the dependent ecosystem services and ensuring capacity building on the islands. An extensive monitoring network is being set up together with island organizations and companies to better keep a finger on the pulse of marine nature, to support nature policy and prevent negative effects, to optimize coral recovery and to build capacity on site. All using the latest techniques in remote sensing, underwater equipment, genetics, chemistry and machine learning. \n\nMy internship at WMR was also part of the MSc thesis I wrote for the study Aquaculture and Marine Resource Management: \"Dynamics of the Deep: The influence of spatial heterogeneity of water quality on dominant benthic groups on Bonaire.\". Within the RESC2N project I was responsible for the Coral surveys with ROV and qater quality measurements. But I also designed my own experiments, helped with lab work, conducted data analysis and assisted with data processing. Furthermore, I have presented the results of my research at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) 2022 in Bremen.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\u2022  Coral reef surveys with a remote operated underwater vehicle (ROV)\n\u2022 Water quality sampling\n\u2022 Statistical analysis\n\u2022 Public speaking",
