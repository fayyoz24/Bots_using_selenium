    "summary": "Especially thanks to what I learned at ITC, I was able to start my career in Remote Sensing and GIS in 1979. My first job was to make a vegetation and landscape map in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). After mapping the vegetation of the coastal dunes in Holland I went back to YAR for rangeland studies. For the FAO I worked in regional forestry projects in Guinea and Thailand. Since 1991 I work for ITC at the Natural Resourses Department. My main focus is on landcover and vegetation mapping and monitoriong as well as marine benthic communities (corals and mussel beds), using remote sensing and geographical information systems. Next to in house training I am involved involved in distance education and development of self learning packages.",
