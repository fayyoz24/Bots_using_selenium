    "summary": "Join The Most Rewarding Summer Academy: UNISCA!\n \nFor over twenty years UNISCA has been organizing Model United Nations (MUN\u2019s) for students from all over the world. We offer students the exciting opportunity to take part in intense, yet intimate debates and to listen to a diverse group of speakers who have expertise over a wide range of topics.\n\nOne of the things that makes our MUN so unique is the combination of the more commonly known MUN model with an academic program. This academic program enables students from all over the world to gain 6 ECs after completion of the course.\n\nThe Summer Course UNISCA 2023 consists of two a two-week academic program from the 3rd of July to the 14th of July. The first week you will attend several lectures and workshops that will prepare you for the conference week. In the second week the actual conference will take place, which will resemble the regular MUN model.\n\nUNISCA offers three tracks. Students can take on the role of delegates and engage in a MUN debate in one of the four committees (UNODC, ECOSOC, HRC, UNSC). Participants can also become journalists in the Press Corps and report on the debates. Finally, the International Court of Justice provides the possibility to play the part of a lawyer or a judge in a court case simulation.\n\nUNISCA combines an invaluable academic opportunity with the possibility to expand your network with students from all over the world. Apply now and enjoy all that our MUN and Amsterdam have to offer for an unforgettable experience.\n\nCheck out our websites: \nhttps://www.uniscamun.org \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/unisca.official/ \n\nhttps://summerschool.uva.nl/content/summer-courses/unisca-summer-academy/unisca-summer-academy.html?origin=PtN3uwswQquDlGtnNX3fZg for more information!",
