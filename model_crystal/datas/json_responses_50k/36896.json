    "summary": "I am a young Dutch professional, currently working as a trainee at the EU Permanent Mission to the World Trade Organization. I am focused on development (cooperation), trade facilitation, and the implementation of LDCs and developing countries into regional and global value chains. \n\nI have a keen interest in matters related to (global and regional) trade, economic cooperation and sustainable development. Through my work, I seek to contribute to positive socioeconomic changes and build solid policy frameworks for generations to come. \n\nMy experience as a professional kickboxer has taught me to never give up and to fight for what you want and believe in. I am a critical thinker with a strong sense of perseverance and adaptability. Additionally, I thrive in an international environment resulting from my experiences of living and working abroad. \n\nI am always eager to discover new challenges and am happy to connect if you think we should discuss opportunities or ideas!",
