In this national event the challenge was to design, build and fly your own (unpowered) aircraft of a 30 m long and 6m high ramp. Using the knowledge of structural engineering that I had recently aquired I designed a glider that was 8m wide and 3m long, yet only weighed 22 kg. I also designed a pully system and did a virtual dynamic test on it using MATLAB simulink. I flew the plane myself before 10.000 spectators and reached a distance of 30m, winning the event. Though to be honest the plane did have a flaw in the aluminum wing design, leading to buckling of the right wing just before hitting the water. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Flugtag#International ",

For one year I worked on the research and design of a pre-combustion carbon capture module for a promising new type of ceramic membranes at the Shell Technology Center in Amsterdam. This involved the numerical simulation of turbulent flow and mass transfer in a membrane module, as well as experiments for determining the strength of ceramic support material. Both the assignment and my assessed internship at Shell have been successfully concluded.",
