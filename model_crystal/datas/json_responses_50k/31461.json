Sir Edmond Gin is an ambitious and fast-growing company born from the desire to create a gin that is truly unique. Since the start of our adventure, we are hitting the shelves in numerous countries , becoming a bartender favorite and continuously stealing the hearts of many gin lovers.\n \nSir Edmond Gin is a rebellious spirit that opens a wide range of drinking possibilities. The way haute cuisine chefs use Bourbon vanilla from the island of R\u00e9union to perform culinary magic, inspired us to create a truly distinctive gin.\n\nSir Edmond Gin is a product of aromatic smoothness. On the nose it has inviting, rich and harmonious notes. A sensation to the palate, giving mellowness, balance and perfect harmony. Finishing with a velvety texture, leaving you wanting more. \n\nSir Edmond Gin is a very easy to sip contemporary gin. Serves neat over ice cubes, works wonderfully in a gin & tonic and is very interesting as a cocktail base.\n\nwww.siredmondgin.com",
