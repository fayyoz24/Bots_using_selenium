We want to challenge every life science researcher to think differently and become the best in their field of expertise. CytoSMART believes that high-end innovative tools should be accessible by all those trying to be at the forefront of scientific discovery. \n\nI have started as the event coordinator for CytoSMART Technologies as a fresh graduate ready to dive into the work world. I entered the company with many ideas and big ambitions to fulfil them. My position was technically project management looking at every event opportunity as a project that has to be lead from beginning until the end - a very diverse, dynamic and creative process, involving a great deal of communication and coordination which luckily I really enjoy. We had a strong start with a few attended and many booked scientific events, and a refreshed exposure approach. However, only half year after we had to readjust to a new world of digital events, due to the global pandemic. For almost one year I worked on virtual editions of scientific events until more capacity was temporarily needed in a different department of our company, which lead to my graduate shift across departments. I kept supporting the event position until a new colleague took over the position fully to allow my switch to finance.",
