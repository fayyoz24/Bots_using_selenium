    "summary": "Landscape Designer, Writer, Researcher.\n\n\ud83d\udc9aAct to improve the well-being of the planet and people & Build a sustainable future with diversity \ud83d\udc9c\n\nMSc in Landscape Architecture & Honours Programme Infrastructures and Environment, Delft University of Technology. \n\nDanyan is a driven landscape designer. She is very passionate about the field where PEOPLE, NATURE and DESIGN meet. Challenge the norm plays an essential part in her thinking process. She aspires to facilitate the transition to sustainable & inclusive cities through design and knowledge sharing. The intersection of landscape design, ecology and geography fascinates her and that led her to specialise in water & climate adaptation design, zero-carbon neighbourhoods and biodiversity recovery. Nature is the inspiration for her designs and paintings. She applies NbS (Nature-based Solutions) across different scales. A system understanding of the landscape and a holistic approach to design allow her to deliver better-performing landscapes which benefit society, biodiversity and the economy. \n\nGrew up in the family with migration background, she moved a lot with her mom in her entire childhood where she learnt to be resilient and look beyond her circumstances. She is a curious and adventurous person with a can-do attitude. She enjoys learning new skills and advancing herself.\n\nShe has lived in China, Netherlands, Ghana and US. She likes travelling and exploring different cultures. She learnt about and understands people who are different from her, which strengthens her in thinking along with the client during the project and reaching a satisfying solution together. Influenced by Dutch culture, she becomes competent in operating systematically and communicating directly. Living across the world empowers her and enables her to see the beauty of diversity, and that's the environment she wants to create - a place everyone can thrive and can be who they are.",

            "description": "Wetlands are the most important ecosystems on Earth, which can be found in many parts of the world. However, demand for food and economic development in the last century had driven many wetlands in the world being completely drained for cultivation and to the extent that no longer retain any natural wetland characteristics such as the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in the United States. The ongoing drainage results in large amounts of peat soil loss and following the decrease of crop production, which has brought the sunset to the agriculture in the EAA. At the same time, it is urgent in South Florida to stop the damaging discharges to the coastal estuaries, to restore the flow of clean water to the Everglades preservation area and to guarantee the freshwater supply in the whole region, which also requires the transformation of the EAA. This master thesis develops an integrated approach for returning the Everglades agricultural lands to nature in order to recover the lost ecological assets in South Florida while balancing the economic value and improving spatial quality. Water is conveyed from Lake Okeechobee and adjacent agricultural lands into the restoration area to be retained and purified through bioremediation process. The purified water will be further recharged into the aquifer and restored as sheet flow into the southern Everglades. Raising the water level and connecting with the local topography create conditions for the natural occurrences. The typical landscape of subtleties varies by the centimetre of water level change is brought back and becomes a space for people to seek experience and to engage themselves with the restored natural rhythms, changing over time. This project demonstrates its potential to be expanded and replicated across a variety of agricultural contexts. It is crucial to balance the ecological and economic value, design through different scales, and include a spatial and experiential dimension during the transformation.",

            "description": "Rapid urbanisation and globalisation are bringing increasingly complex issues to the forefront. Improper planning of human activities and over exploitation of the surrounding natural resources has successfully damaged the biodiversity and the natural processes. Today humanity is at a stage where these ecosystem services are essential for our existence but the resources have been exploited beyond their capacity. In addition, climate change adds additional long-term threats due to erratic weather patterns and extreme natural events. Coastal Lagoons are one such geographical feature where such complexities are very visible. Given the high fertility of the surrounding land and the biodiversity hosted by the lagoons, they are rich resource banks for settlements to thrive on. This has led to issues like water pollution, loss of biodiversity and urban encroachment. Despite protection from the international communities like the Ramsar Convention, most wetlands are degrading everyday. The need of the hour is to find innovative middle ground solutions, where the services can be availed without degrading the environment. Further, to plan these services in a way that they are instrumental in reviving and enriching the lost ecosystem. This project attempts to present on such design and strategy for the Muni-Pomadze Lagoon (MPL) in Ghana. Considering the complexity of the issues, the project chose a interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to produce a holistic solution for the site. Further, it uses the principles of Nature-Based Design and 4-P framework (People, Planet, Prosperity and Project) to guide and reflect on the design. (van Dorst & Duijvestein 2004) This report attempts to contribute to the research on interdisciplinary design processes. Further, it aims to be a starting point and guideline for the Forestry Commission and Municipal body of Winneba, for better conservation of the Muni Lagoon.",
