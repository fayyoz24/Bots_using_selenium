We were positioning lighting as the simple, undisruptive, and unobtrusive way to help cities / municipalities cut their emissions by more than doubling their infrastructure renovation to 4% by 2030, helping to meet their sustainability goals.\n\nasks performed:\n- maximizing the potential of BrightEdge & SEMRush, as an SEO tool, providing in-depth research findings to the markets and their verticals\n- performing data analysis within Google Search Console &\n- providing advice with regards to SEO on-page optimization, as well as digital marketing activation\n- project managing various SEO projects, and adapting to each market's priorities\n- suggesting data driven possibilities for future marketing strategies",
