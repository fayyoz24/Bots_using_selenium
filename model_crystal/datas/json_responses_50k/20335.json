    "summary": "I did my bachelor degree in Food Technology Departement, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH). After finishing undergraduate, I went to work at Food Technology Department, UPH as lecturer assistant.  Currently, I was graduated from master programme Wageningen University & Research in Food Technology, Specialisation Dairy Science and Technology. \n\nDuring my master studies, I am also an awardee of Anne Van den Ban Fund (ABF), Dairy Science and Technology (DST) fellowship, and Holland Scholarship International Master Programme from Wageningen University and Research.\n\nI'm a hard-worker, organised, and adaptable with interest in working on the relation with protein, ingredients, and dairy product development. Right now, I continue working at Universitas Pelita Harapan as an associate lecturer in Food Technology Study Program\n\n\n",

Starch is a biodegradable polymer produced in abundance which have been used extensively as a replacer for plastic polymer. Previous research has been able to incorporate 50% of durian starches into a plastic packaging. However the resulted plastic has low physical and mechanical properties. Therefore in this research additional plasticizer and filler were added to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the durian biocomposite.\nChitosan has been widely used as a material or addition in the various plastic biocomposite due to unique structure and biocompability with various material. Chitosan addition is known to increase the biodegradation rate and physicochemical characteristic of bioplastic. Therefore in this research formulated biocomposites using combination of durian starches, sago starches and chitosan were made and tested for its physicochemical properties and biodegradable quality after burial in soil medium for 6 weeks. Water Absorption Characteristic, Degradation Rate, Physical and Mechanical Properties and SEM analysis were perfomed to furthed divulge the potency of the new formulated biocomposite.",

In this research, four types of oil obtained locally (palm, coconut, soybean, and corn oil) were used in a repeated frying model using tempeh as food model. The repetition was done until 15 times at 180\u00b0C\u00b1 50\u00b0C with 5 minutes frying time in each repetition and 5 minutes intermittent time between each repetition. \nGC analysis showed decrease in total fatty acid in all oils, especially in those abundant in poly-unsaturated fatty acid while there is aninsignificant increase in trans fatty acids throughout the frying. There is a significant effect of oil type and frying repetition toward the deterioration level of frying oil.\nThe deteriorations are also exhibited in the gradual increase of the FFA, Totox values and the increase in the formation of secondary oxidation products (conjugated diene and triene). Sensory analysis showed that rancid aroma of palm and coconut oil gradually increased until the 15th frying, meanwhile soybean and corn oil reached their peak point on the 1st frying and remained stable until the 15th frying. Rancid aroma was also found higher in tempeh fried with the 15th times used oil along with savory taste and preference.\n",

Fermentation using lactic acid bacteria is known to produce lactic acid which contributing on baking expansion properties, but strains of lactic acid has different ability to degrade starch. \nIn this research, cassava was fermented using mixed culture: Saccharomayces cerevisiae with L.plantarum, L.achidophilus, dan combination between L.plantarum dan L.achidophilus with ratio 1:1. Different fermentation time, fermentation temperature, starter and skim concentration were observed in order to produce fermented cassava flour with high content of protein, low cyanide concentration, and good baking properties. \nAnalysis was conduct for selected fermented cassava flour: protein content, cyanide content, spesific volume, peak viscosity using RVA, and whiteness level. \n\n\nis obtain fermentation cassava flour with good characteristic by protein content, cyanide content, peak viscosity using (RVA), whiteness level, and baking expansion properties. In this research, fermentation done by mixed starter Sacharomyces cerevisiae 2% and type of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, L. achidophilus, and the combination L. plantarum and  L. achidophilus).",
