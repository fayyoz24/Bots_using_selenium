    "summary": "I am a motivated, enthusiastic, and eager to learn PhD candidate at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of Maastricht University, where I also completed a MSc in Cultures of Arts, Science, and Technology and my BA in Arts & Culture. \n\nBoth of my degree were very interdisciplinary studies, which allowed me to satisfy my boundless curiosity. However broad as my academic background may be, my interests have always been centred broadly on issues surrounding technology, politics, and epistemology. Both my BA and MSc have had a strong focus on developing skills concerned with academic research and writing on interdisciplinary topics. During my studies I've had the opportunity to write about a myriad of topics from Donald Trump's conspiracist populism, how the affordances of the social media platform \"Reddit\" influence the perceived epistemic value of the information on the platform, and more recently about the intersection of generative AI technologies with higher education institutions. \n\nNow, my PhD research will explore issues of diversity and bias in AI systems for media. My research is part of the Trustworthy AI for Media (TAIM) lab, and is conducted in close collaboration with RTL News and the University of Amsterdam. \n\nHaving lived in 10 different cities among 7 countries, I have a heightened sense of cultural awareness and can optimistically interact with people in an assured, diplomatic, and poised manner. I excel in environments where collaboration and team work are encouraged. I am passionate about climate and social justice, and am dedicated to one day of being a part of multilateral organizations, like the UN and the EU, or NGOs as a policy advisor on technology's role in society.\n\nI am an organized and efficient worker who\u2019s at my happiest when I can make other people happy. Through my work experience alongside my studies, I developed an invaluable work ethic as well as time management and organizational skills. \n\nDuring cherished moments by myself, I dabble a little on the ukulele but I am a long way away from being a maker of music rather than just a lover of music. During those cozy-days-in, I love baking treats for my friends and neighbors.",

I was the first line of contact for the organization, and I helped re-direct interested parties to the person most suitable for their needs. I made sure things were getting done smoothly, and I presented feasible solutions for when problems appeared.\nOrganized and collaborated on various campaigns to increase knowledge of sexual violence. Created the #EmpoweringUsAtUM campaign with the Diversity & Inclusivity office of Maastricht University. Balanced tasks while enrolled as a full-time student."
