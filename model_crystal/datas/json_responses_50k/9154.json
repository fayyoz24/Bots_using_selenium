    "summary": "I\u2019m a master student electromechanics with a specialization in automation at the University of Antwerp. I did my master\u2019s thesis at AG Solution with the subject PAA, and the possibility too improve the Automation workflow for PCS7 projects. I\u2019m currently working happily at AG solution for PCS7 and TIA portal projects and everything that surrounds it.\n\nBefore my studies at the university of Antwerp I studied Automation at the AP University and did an internship at SIETEC, Terneuzen. The topic of my internship was improving the ergonomics for the operators at a production line and writing a proposal to automate the tasks in the future. I gained more experience in this internship in Simatic manager, safety (CE) for production installations, automatic label applicator, and vision.\n\nMy industrial experience started even before this with internships in high school in the process industry at Trinseo, Terneuzen and other internships. At my main high school internship I designed and build an electrical cabinet for an installation I designed with two other students. I also gained experience in CE regulation and AREI for products through my bachelor thesis at the university of Antwerp.\n\nAbout myself: I like sporting (running and skating), Esports, and keeping myself up to date with the newest technology.",
