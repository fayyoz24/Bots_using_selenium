    "summary": "Hardworking, studious and people-oriented are characteristics that depict me. I have a great sense of responsibility and I want to be the best version of myself and help others to achieve the same. I think it is really important that organizations have an interest in people and are sincere in the attention they give their employees. Besides that, I also think it is important to keep developing soft skills as well as hard skills. I am really curious and like to learn about new subjects. I also am interested in how processes are designed, and I like to dive deeper into these processes as to gain more insight into them. My interest in people and my interest in work related processes will ensure that I can combine a people-oriented approach with a task-oriented approach. ",
