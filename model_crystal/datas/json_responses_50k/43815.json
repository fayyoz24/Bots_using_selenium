    "summary": "I am a Polymer Engineer. My bachelor covered every aspect of polymer technology, from Physical Properties (Crystallisation, nucleation, thermal and morphological behaviour) and Processing (Rheology, Viscoelasticity, Extrusion, Injection), to the Design of Plastic parts (CAD/CAE). I have Master Studies on Polymer Characterisation with a focus on Thermal Properties of Polymers (Crystallisation and Thermal Fractionation (SSA)). I did my PhD thesis on the Design of Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells applications, using sulfonated PEEK as Electrolyte. During my PhD i worked with Impedance Spectroscopy, DSC and Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy as my principal techniques of characterisation.\n",

The ADEM programme covers the themes of Wind, Storage, Batteries, Membranes, Solar cells and Fuel cells. For more information, please refer to the dedicated programme page.\n\nADEM Innovation Lab strengthens the Dutch knowledge economy with joint expertise and an open and shared research infrastructure. The programme aims to materialise innovations in energy technologies in close collaboration with industry. For this reason, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs supports this initiative with substantial funding.\n\nIndustrial partners can participate with cash or in-kind contributions of 10% or higher in ADEM\u2019s research and make use of the shared research infrastructure.

                    "description": "Previous research has indicated that sulfonated Poly (Ether Ether Ketone) polymers can be used as electrolytes for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell's (PEMFC). This polymer has a good mechanical stability and partially retains water over 100\u00b0C. However, the membranes have a low proton conductivity in comparison to Nafion\u00ae (commercial standard).\nThe PEM for fuel cells needs to allow migration of protons from one side of the membrane to the other as efficient and fast as possible. Here we address the first strong point of our investigation. Generally, the structural order of the inner phase of the membrane has been overseen. In our work, it is proven that is possible, through a procedure of successive thermal treatments, to give order to these channels in the membrane, to follow this order by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy and to find the optimal for proton conductivity.\nOur second and final point refers to the means of proton mobility. In most cases, as for example in sPEEK , the migration of protons are believed to happen through the channels that are created in the material by the water and driven by the acidic side groups in the polymer. In this sense, the increase of water in the system without diminish the acidic groups responsible of the protonation of the water or compromising the mechanical stability of it is essential. These facts brought our attention to the use of Inorganic fillers on the membrane matrix as a way to introduce water or acidic groups that helps with the proton mobility. \nThe final goal was to prepare a hybrid membrane capable of conduct protons at similar values of Nafion\u00ae at 100\u00b0C and also to further understand the factors that affect the proton conduction in pure and hybrid PEM.",
