    "summary": "A successful product innovation is by no means the outcome of a standardized formula or recipe. However, with 10+ years of experience as a Product Innovator I can definitely say that the main ingredients are almost always the same: well-defined user needs mixed with a dose of desirability, technological feasibility and economic viability. Add these to a competent project team and see the surprising solutions and exciting concepts turn into industrialized products.  \n\nWant an even better outcome? Add a pinch of fun on top of a well-defined brand-driven product vision and you\u2019ll see not only the result adding immense value to the company, its brand and portfolio, but that the innovation process will also energize the entire team that is involved.\n\nMy task at Spark is to manage new product development processes, to identify new innovation and project opportunities and to fuel the creative process. I genuinely love taking on creative and technical challenges. More often than not do I enter the ring myself to create sketches, prototypes, 3D models and visuals that inspire all involved and that make ideas tangible. \n\nI have the luxury of working with a team of 30+ highly capable and passionate colleagues, with access to a worldwide network of (production) partners and suppliers. Backed by a company with 25+ years of relevant innovation experience and a company culture that encourages the pursuit of improvement on every level. I believe we are as close as we can to finding the ultimate innovation formula.",
