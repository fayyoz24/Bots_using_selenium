    "summary": "I am currently only seeking part-time work or contract jobs. I am unable to take on full-time, long-term jobs.\n\nHistory:\n\nI launched 'Goaheadspace, Amsterdam' in 2009, re-naming it 'Goaheadspace', a few years ago.\n\nPreviously, I had been in the team that created the company XS4ALL Internet, from 1996-2009, allowing me to develop from enthusiastic amateur to senior developer, working with a solid team of expert programmers. \n\nI have many successful contracts under my belt, in a variety of fields, including community sites, e-commerce, 'visiting card' sites etc. I have worked with organizations such as the European Library, Project Aware, Global Center for Cultural Entrepreneurs and, more recently, Digitale Radio Mondiale.\n\nI have successfully worked, not only with client-side design, front-end development & maintenance of a number of new dynamic websites or re-designing/improving existing outdated and primitive sites, but also the lock-down, analysis and subsequent resurrection of some maliciously hacked sites and the securing of them, once restored. \n\nMy priority is always with security - but I also am highly concerned with functionality, cosmetic design, search engine optimization, working to certified standards and paying serious attention to the fine details, which may make or break a site.\n\nSpecialtiies: \n\nSpecialities include GUI design, building & securing Open Source CMSs and many of the framework based core technologies behind them - PHP, HTML5, HTML5, XHTML, CSS, Apache, mySQL and Javascript (inc. some libraries and frameworks). Either Joomla! or WordPress is the CMS choice of most clients.\n\nI have become very knowledgeable about Joomla! & its vast OpenSource library, to achieve almost everything possible, on any suitable web-site.\n\nI build plugins, templates & extensions, for Joomla & understand how to lock them down, secure them, extend their functionality & cosmetically design them, to a high standard - W3C, WCAG etc.\n",
