    "summary": "I am currently Research director of Recycling Lab at Delft University of Technology. After the MSc in Chemical Engineering (Palermo University, Italy) I got my PhD degree in Environmental Technical Physics at the Department of Technical Physics of Palermo University in 2002. In 1999 I joined the Energy Technology Section at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Delft University of Technology to work on heating, ventilating and air conditioning system (HVAC) simulations and design as well as on Energy Savings buildings issues. From 2002 to 2005 I have been involved in research on Energy Saving Technology at the Building Energy Research Centre of Tsinghua University (Beijing).  From September 2006 I am a staff member of the group of Resources & Recycling (Section Materials and Environment) at Delft University of Technology. I have been the initiator and coordinator of a few European funded projects in developing countries such as: Toward a better Environment: Implementation of Energy Saving Building in China as well as Human Resources Development for the Improvement and Protection of Environment in Asia. I have the ambition to positively contribute with my work to the society. That is why I do enjoy working of Resource Efficiency, Circular Economy and Recycling issues. To this extent I initiated and coordinated two European projects: (1) Magnetic Sorting and Ultrasound Sensor Technologies for Production of High Purity Secondary Polyolefins from Waste (W2Plastics) and (2) Advanced Technologies for the Production of Cement and Clean Aggregates from Construction and Demolition Waste (C2CA). Both projects resulted in two spin-off companies that are exploiting the innovative technologies on the market. Currently I am contributing to the Circular Economy and in particular to the Policy for innovation field, by developing a functional new methodology that can steer industrial actors towards innovations that effectively decouple economic growth from material input.\n",
