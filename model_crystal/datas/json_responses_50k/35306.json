    "summary": "Digitalisation, automatisation and new ways of working have an increasing influence on companies and their bussinessmodels. Taking this into account, HR will have to focus more than ever before on creating cooperation across (company)boundaries, life-long learning for employees, continued investment in the creation of different leadershipstyles and, last but not least, dare to vary in compensation & benefits.\n\nAs an HR professional I function best if I have responsibility and accountability in a strategic or tactical function within a dynamic international environment. I switch easily between policy & strategic positioning of the organization and the focus on practical solutions so results are actually achieved.\n\nI am analytical, enthusiastic, pragmatic and optimistic. I want to achieve goals together, while connecting people and teams. If needed I\u2019m firm and frank, with respect and understanding of people\u2019s beliefs and values.",

The assignment was to get back full control of the IT services within 6 months, without the 200 sourced ATOS employees changing employer. \nMy contribution:\n\u2022 Manage HR IT project team consisting of 2 HR specialists, 3 HR advisers and 2 HR support (6 FTE);\n\u2022 HR scenario analysis; taking into account laws and regulations, collective agreements (CAO) and Achmea HR IT strategy;\n\u2022 Translation of analysis to final advice and documentation;\n\u2022 Responsible for all HR aspects during set-up.\n\nResult: Set-up of a virtual venture within set deadline, which integrated virtual collaboration of 400 IT employees. Realization of a one-time cost reduction of over 600.000 euros in personnel costs and organizational structure and processes fitting within Achmea policy.\n\nMigration of peripheral customer support activities to central CCC (Customer Contact Center).\nAdministrative and telephone support by CCC was long decentralized. Centralization created a new business unit that resulted in redundancy as well as new jobs. \nMy contribution:\n\u2022 Hierarchically managing an HR project team (4 fte) during this transition  which was responsible for processing all staffing implications;\n\u2022 Implement strategic and tactical aspects: create dashboard with indicators and target values, consultation with the Works Council and cooperation with staffing agencies;\n\u2022 Various operational aspects: handling personnel changes, conduct redundancy interviews and organizing interview/hiring days for new staff.\n\nAchieved result: migration and dismantling of existing organization carried out according to plan, reduction of 32 FTEs.
