Working closely with the board of the federation, local angling associations and local authorities we are discussing to extend the locations where the carp anglers can fish during the night with the use of a small shelter. We also are working on extending the locations where the use of three rods is permitted.\n\nEvery year we make an inventory among all the local angler associations to see if it is required for stocking up the lakes or rivers with carp. We train and assist them with these projects. This includes negotiations with government officials, possibility for financing, monitoring and contact with suppliers. \n\nThe committee is coaching volunteers of the local angling association in training youth on all topics involving fishing on carp. The lessons include different ways of methods to teach the children about biology, bait, health and tactics. The committee is present on events which are organized by either the local angling association or by the federation of angling associations. \n"

We maintain a nationwide network of all project leaders which are involved in stocking programs for carp. The BVK is advising and coaching angling associations, federation of angling associations, professional fishermen and regional water authorities in how to maintain the carp population. The information provided from all the projects are analyzed to gain more insights in migration, survival and growth of the different breeds of carp which are provided by different carp farms. We closely work together with carp farms to get the best ideal scaled mirror carp for an acceptable price for the angling associations."
