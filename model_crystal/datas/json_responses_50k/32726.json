    "summary": "Hi! I am Medhavi, a second-year MSc Chemical Engineering student at TU Delft, the Netherlands. I have received Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering (Gold Medalist) from Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University, India. My areas of interest include process control and optimization, transport phenomena, hydrogen technology, and process and product design. \n\nDuring my master thesis project, I developed an algorithm which can make continuous 'visualisation' of the ongoing phenomena in a process vessel. Such an algorithm can be used for real-time analysis or as post-processing technique for better optimization and process control. This work is elaborated in my thesis is titled, 'An Integral Approach for Field Reconstruction based on the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition: A Proof of Concept for Discrete Data obtained using Flow-Following Temperature Sensors'. \n\nAlongside academics, I have assisted for two master-level courses, 'Advanced Thermodynamics' and 'Molecular Transport Phenomena. For Advanced Thermodynamics, I help students with their Aspen Plus-based assignments. For Molecular Transport Phenomena, I assisted the professor in renewing the content of the course. Besides as community officer, I acted as a mentor to a group of ten first-year master's students and helped them with their academic and personal problems. Apart from these roles, I held the treasury of the Faculty Student Council - Applied Sciences for the year 2022-23 and took charge as Secretary OV. These varied responsibilities have facilitated the development of a good team spirit along with professional skills which have helped me in getting a chance to communicate well with people from different walks of life.",

The design of novel reactors and the detailed analysis of these new as well as existing models is of paramount importance for their efficient utilization. Modeling and simulation are essential tools in design and scale-up of the reactors, and as the performance requirements are growing, it is needed that any proposed reactor model would be able to define not only spatial distribution of involved species but also temperature and velocity profiles within the reactor. The main limitation in the ordinary models is the poor knowledge of flow and thermal patterns within the reactors. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has proven to be a reliable tool for modeling and simulating flow and heat transfer phenomena while designing a process equipment. In this work, we have analysed the role of CFD as a powerful tool to produce predictions for the flow and thermal behaviour in complex reactor designs based on the numerical resolution of the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy. The validated models may be then used to investigate flow characteristics like temperature, pressure and flow rates of the reactants and products. The results can, in turn, be used to evaluate the performance and limitations of different reactor designs.",
