    "summary": "Studying English culture and literature at the Beijing Forestry University, I discovered my deep fascination for cultural differences. This led me to do my master\u2019s in London, where I did audiovisual translation. The more I learned, the more I was gravitated to the intricacies involved in translation, especially for Chinese and English, where the differences in language but also in culture are stark. Translation has opened a new world for me, and I\u2019m so excited to share that and make it more accessible for people. Because of both my interpersonal and language skills, I have been able to make deep connections with people from Asia, Africa as well as Europe, with whom I\u2019ve been involved in multiple projects for the last three years. Working on these projects, I believe that I have acquired the necessary skills to be a qualified project manager.",
