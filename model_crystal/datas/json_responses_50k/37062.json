            "description": "In this research studio we worked as a team on mapping the behaviour of pedestrians in the city centre of Rotterdam. We used GPS devices to track the routes people use and gained extra information with a questionnaire. The aim was to find out how pedestrians use the shopping areas.\n\nWhy do people use certain parts of the city center and avoid others? What kind of shopping rounds do people make? And  to what extend does the urban form of the city influence the behavior and experience of pedestrians? This research is conducted in cooperation with the urban research department of the municipality of Rotterdam. \nThe research method was based on GPS tracking with small devices, interviews and in depth spatial analyses. A mixed group (age, family composition, living location) of people was selected to participate during 4 different days of the week within 3 weeks. In four crucial parking garages in the center, people received a gps-device when they left the parking. A 10 minute questionnaire was taken when the participants returned that included questions about the purpose of the visit and the quality of the shopping experience. Borders and edges of neighborhoods are found based on cumulative results and on the dominant walking patterns of the participants.\n \nCloser research into specific road crossings has been conducted to better understand the reasons for the behavior of pedestrians. Is a street easy to cross, are there reasons to stay, is there enough program for our shoppers? Even more interesting was the analysis of the areas that were not used. We found out that for instance the Aert van Nesstraat is relatively underused, even while it could provide a logical route between the Meent and the Lijnbaan.",
