Working with clients such as IBM and The Barbican.\n\nAt project level I acted as a bridge between design team, client and collaborators - ensuring to create an environment for which the projects could grow, both creatively and commercially. At company level I took part in developing new processes and policies, as well as exploring new business and managing resourcing.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed working alongside the very talented teams at both companies, the collaboration came to an end so I could pursue a move to the city of Amsterdam.",
