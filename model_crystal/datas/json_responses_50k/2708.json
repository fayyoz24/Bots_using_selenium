    "summary": "I am a graduate of the MA programme in Holocaust & Genocide Studies (MA) at NIOD/University of Amsterdam. Throughout both my academic and professional career, I have committed myself to the field of human rights, with a particular focus on violence against civilians in contemporary conflict. \n\nPreviously, for NGOs and within the UN system (OHCHR), I have worked across communications, research and reporting, and advocacy. In addition, on a consultancy basis, I have worked with non-profits within the sustainable investment/impact finance sector to provide human rights/conflict analysis through the lens of ESG.\n\nI am confident in my abilities as a rigorous researcher, sharp analyst, and engaging writer. Currently working independently, I have been published by both respected think tanks and international media outlets (see publications). My writing is based on strong qualitative research skills, including open-source methodologies and trauma-sensitive interviews with victims of human rights abuses. Through my work I seek to amplify the voices of conflict affected populations and build an in-depth and localised analysis of complex contexts.",
