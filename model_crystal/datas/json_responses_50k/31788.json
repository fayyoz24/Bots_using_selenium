The question was how to improve the protection against flooding in the Netherlands. Our concept is to invest in resilience rather than just protection against flooding. This is achieved by creating a consciousness within the Dutch community of the inherent risks that come with living below sea level. This is done along 3 themes: consciousness, reinforcement and cooperation. The ideas are relatively easy to implement as they connect to existing networks and infrastructure rather than creating new. The concept was credited for its innovation in its thinking and the possibility to implement the measures on a short term.",
