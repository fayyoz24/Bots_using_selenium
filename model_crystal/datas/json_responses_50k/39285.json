    "summary": "\ud83c\udf3f Co-founder of Dazzle | We match top-tier sustainability freelancers to organizations who need their support\n\nMy mission is to revolutionize the way businesses approach sustainability \ud83d\ude80 and with Dazzle, to make the necessary expertise more (financially accessible)\n\n\ud83c\udf93 With a background in Business Administration, my career initially led me to the world of marketing. Over the past 6 years, I've honed my skills in this domain and have been fortunate to work with exceptional teams. However, it was my growing concern for the environment and human welfare that prompted a profound shift in my focus. \n\n\ud83c\udf31 Four years ago, I took the leap into sustainability, first as a freelancer for a consulting firm that shared my values. The experience was eye-opening, and it fueled my drive to make a lasting impact. Alongside my friend and colleague Robert, who excelled as the head of sales at the same consulting firm, we embarked on a shared vision\u2014founding Dazzle.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Dazzle is more than just a platform; it's a movement. We believe that every organization, regardless of size, can be a catalyst for positive change. We are building a thriving community of top-tier freelancers, empowering them with the tools and resources they need to drive transformation. \n\n\ud83d\udd06 Sustainability is not just a buzzword for us; it's a personal passion and a shared commitment. Witnessing the devastating effects of environmental degradation and inequality, I am fueled by an unyielding desire to rewrite this narrative. Together, we can make sustainability the new status quo, fostering a world that is equal and just.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc At Dazzle, we're taking bold strides toward our vision. My aspiration is to grow Dazzle into the go-to platform for sustainable transformation. A place where companies can find tailored solutions, and freelancers can thrive while driving impactful change.\n\nLet's connect and explore how we can work together in making a sustainable difference.",
