    "summary": "Coming all the way from the United States, I have made the Netherlands my home. Driven by my passion for crafting a more sustainable urban landscape through people-first decision-making and embracing circular practices in the built environment, I am passionate about implementing sustainable urban development. My career path now is all about diving into architectural research and sustainable design practices to assist in designing human-centered built environments that create a positive social environment and environment.\n\nMy heart lies in exploring avenues for sustainable urban development. My mission is to dig deep into topics like tackling gender-based inequalities, creating a circular built environment, and championing the cause of just and equitable city development. Armed with a B.Arch in Architecture and an M.Sc in Urban Management and Development from Erasmus University, specializing in Strategic Urban Planning and Policy, I am well-equipped to contribute insights that matter to the social and spatial fabric of urban areas.\n\nBack in 2019, I kicked off my design journey with EYP, now known as Page Southerland Page, as an architectural designer. Throughout my time there, my focus spanned a variety of projects in higher education, healthcare, behavioral healthcare, and government sectors. I thrived in interdisciplinary collaborations, working hand in hand with planners, architects, engineers, and sustainability consultants. As an architectural designer, I was the creative force behind project designs, harmonizing inputs from diverse team members to conjure up captivating and aesthetically pleasing solutions that catered to client's needs and the ultimate users' experience.\n\nIn the year 2021, I took a leap from individual building designs to the grander stage of citywide development. Despite my love for architecture and design, my curiosity drove me to uncover the underlying causes of modern urban challenges. This curiosity was born from my deep empathy for individuals, especially women and marginalized communities, who grapple with social disparities in urban settings. My aspiration? To uncover pragmatic solutions. With a keen eye on stakeholder management, the principles of feminist urban planning, and a genuine concern for the societal impacts of urbanization, my academic pursuits led her to the Netherlands, signaling a shift towards a research-centric sustainable urban development journey.",
