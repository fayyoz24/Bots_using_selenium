                    "description": "Interior and Exterior Design for Luxury Yachts\n\nI launched Guido de Groot Design in 1997, specializing in innovative interiors and exteriors for both luxury motor and sailing yachts. Being a car designer gave me a good understanding of shapes and surfaces, and a keen sense for 3-D objects. Both cars and yachts are sold primarily on their aesthetics and the presentation of prototypes and drawings is equally crucial to owners of premium cars and superyachts.\n \nMy love affair with yachts began back in 1986 when I saw the fourth \u201cHighlander\u201d close to completion at the De Vries (Feadship) yard. Awestruck by the majesty of this 45-metre masterpiece, I started drawing yachts in parallel with my career in car design. The next decade was spent learning everything there was to know about luxury yachts.\n \nThe design studio is based in Leiden, the oldest university town in Holland, employing seven people of varying nationalities. These days, our office has expanded, to the point that we are working with an international clientele and collaborating with prestigious shipyards, building yachts in The Netherlands, Italy, China, Russia, Taiwan and Turkey. The sizes and types of yachts range from a 20 metre sailing yacht through to a 65 metre exploration luxury yacht, and are including fast motor cruisers and more sedate displacement yachts.",
