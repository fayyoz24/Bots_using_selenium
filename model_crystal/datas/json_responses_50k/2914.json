Apart from a 25m competition pool with seating for spectators, visitors can use the learner pool, which will be provided with a moveable floor to accommodate different activities. The wet area will also offer a sauna & steamroom.\n\nThe 6 court sports hall is suitable for many different sports and because of its dividing wall, it can be used by several groups at the same time. Furthermore a fitness suite, cycling studio and two dance studios will be on offer as well as a seven meter high climbing wall and Kid\u2019s Play area. Other areas include reception, caf\u00e9 with seating area, offices, changing areas etc. Externally, six synthetic surface MUGA pitches, a 7-a-side pitch and five 5-a-side leisure pitches will be provided as well as parking space.\n\nIn a team with operator Places for People Leisure, Roberts Limbrick Architects and project managers Press & Starkey, Pellikaan will be responsible for the design and build construction of the new facilities. Having worked together on similar projects before, the team was able to work efficiently with the council to complete the PPP contract for the design, build, operation and maintenance of the centre in an exceptionally short period of time.",

The access road to the Football Club is within the site boundary and was kept open for the players and public throughout the project. \n\nThe low carbon energy philosophy influenced design and engineering decisions: a biomass boiler, pool covers and solar panels were installed; and throughout the building, laminated timber beams and columns are used as well as cross laminated timber roof and wall panels. This resulted in several awards. \n\nDuring construction, Pellikaan cooperated closely with council and other local stakeholders about awareness and education regarding the project. The construction process, health & safety issues and related matters were taught on schools by Pellikaan staff, after which the school children toured the site at various times during construction. Pellikaan also supported local goals including the local eco art week and sponsorship of Horley Town FC.",

The new centre has a 5 lane 25-meter pool with viewing area, a learner pool, fitness, sauna area, reception and changing facilities. \n\nThe existing centre stayed open until the new centre was handed over. Site location is next to the bus station, across the street from the library / council office and in front of the football fields where the Sunderland reserves play their matches on weeknights. \n\nReuse demolition materials\nReuse of materials is generally encouraged at our projects and is mostly possible on projects which involve demolition works. In Hetton Le Hole, over 85% of the demolished building is re-used. The sports hall membrane roof was sold on to a farmer in Yorkshire. The roof joists were denailed and used as fence posts in Birmingham. All metal was weighed-in and re-cycled. Three trees that were felled were given to local residents for their wood burner stoves. \n\nAlso, our waste carrier in Hetton-Le-Hole has a recycling rate of 85% for all waste materials and is investing in machinery that will increase this rate into +90%. \n",

            "description": "In Watford, Pellikaan won a contract for two leisure centres at Central and Woodside.\nAt Central, the existing swimming pool in the town centre was demolished and replaced\nby a new sports centre. The new centre encompasses a 6 lane 25 meter swimming pool as\nwell as a children\u2019s pool, a sports hall, viewing areas, fitness area and exercise studio.\nIn addition, the centre has a great climbing wall, covering three storeys. The wall is an\nimportant feature in the entrance and lobby areas. Other facilities include a cr\u00e8che, caf\u00e9,\nmeeting rooms, offices and wet and dry changing facilities.\n\nSustainability was a key consideration in the design. It resulted in winning the International\nGreen Apple Award. The long term viability of the centre is increased through significant\nrenewable energy features, both in terms of a reduction in carbon emissions and in running\ncosts. Some examples are high insulation levels, a solar thermal array, rainwater recycling\nand heat recovery systems to reclaim heat from air and water. The extended ground source\nheat pump system, using boreholes of approx. 100 metres deep, enables use of the natural\nheat of the earth. The system also re-uses excess heat generated by cooling. Furthermore,\nheat loss and emission of carbon dioxide by air leakage were reduced significantly.",

Enough reason for Matthew Towers in Bedford to make a commitment to himself, that if he was ever in a position to improve the racquets and gym facilities in his town, he would make it happen.\n\nNow, many years later, it happened: Bedford got a high-end health & racquets club with no less than 3 indoor and 4 outdoor tennis courts, 4 squash courts, a gym, high energy studio, mind & body studio and a state-of-the-art spin studio. The wet side of the centre will have a 20 meter pool, sauna, steam room, feature shower and hydropool. Further relaxation can be found upstairs in the wellness treatment rooms, or in the bar/caf\u00e9 area, where you can find a quiet area as well as a dedicated kids club.",
