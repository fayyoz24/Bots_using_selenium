    "summary": "I am a Controls Engineer with experience on advanced controls for trains and turbines, and on data analytics for the aviation segment. I have a Masters Degree on Mixed-Integer Optimization applied to control systems. \n\nI work at GE Global Research Center in Rio since Feb 2012, where I participated on R&D projects related to the following fields:\n* Air traffic simulation and optimization, which led to a contract of tens of millions of dollars.\n* Flight data analytics, for new functionalities on the GE Aviation Digital EMS suite.\n* Heavy haul train modeling, controls and optimizing controls, for the Trip Optimizer product.\n* Model-based estimation and optimizing controls for wind turbines and hydroelectric turbines.\n* Systems identification, modeling and controls for mining.\n\nBefore that I worked at the LEAD laboratory at UFRJ where I conducted research in fieldbuses for intelligent devices, during a joint research initiative with a major petrochemical company. During this period I also conducted my Masters, in which I developed an optimization strategy for scheduling of measurement and control tasks, and device-to-device communication for fieldbuses.\n\nExpertise: Control systems, optimizing control, optimization, mathematical modeling, systems integration, data analytics, fieldbuses, instrumentation, automation.",

For the first time, we were able to compute the actual performance of those systems and thereby their provided savings, which can indeed be substantial. To achieve that, we used a combination of tools from computer science, such as reactive synthesis and formal verification, and the theory of networked and hybrid control systems. We devised new methods and algorithms to qualitatively analyzing the behavior of event-triggered controllers (which can exhibit chaotic timing behavior), compute their resource-usage, as well as means of optimizing their performance, scheduling multiple systems in a shared network.",
