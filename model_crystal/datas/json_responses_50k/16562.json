    "summary": "Driven by the power of innovation, my goal is to enable the tech ecosystem to build valuable and sustainable\u00a0collaborations that do good for the world. With genuine enthusiasm, expertise in innovation, and passion for making connections I support corporations and governments to unlock the hidden knowledge of the tech ecosystem to uncover\u00a0new growth opportunities.\u00a0\n\nSince 2019, I have been working at TNW - a Financial Times Company. I've been responsible for setting up new partnerships with corporate\u00a0innovation leaders such as Volvo, Heineken, and Unilever and governments\u00a0& cities such as the municipality of Rotterdam, Singapore Tourism Board, and GIZ.\u00a0\n\nDuring the pandemic, I mastered Business Administration and specialized in Innovation & (corporate) entrepreneurship at the University of Amsterdam | Amsterdam Business School. Combining it together with my job at TNW taught me how much one can achieve with a bunch of perseverance, enthusiasm, and eagerness. Today, I apply my academic expertise on a strategic level with corporations and governments on their open innovation journey.\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime, I want to pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions to build my own startup company.\n\nI'm always eager to meet new people passionate about innovation, the tech ecosystem, or entrepreneurship\u00a0(or something new).",
