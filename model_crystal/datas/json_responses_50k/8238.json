I appreciate working in a dynamic group environment, but also work well independently. I have experience prioritising and delegating tasks in leadership roles such as my position as Deputy Manager in Boylesports and Vice Chairperson in my alma mater's 'Niteline' Association. Alongside my studies, I enjoy delving into a plethora of music genres and supporting the Ireland and Munster rugby teams.",
