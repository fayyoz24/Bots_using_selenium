    "summary": "I believe that health impacts everything - including how individuals and societies function at large, to the potential impact of a project.  So that is where I focus my energy. With this idea, I've ventured into a variety of positions which address health, with the goal of identifying and understanding the barriers and enablers to good health. The main topics I've worked with include: HIV, Malaria, Water and Sanitation, Nutrition, Female Empowerment, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Worker's Health, Noma, and especially, Sexual Violence. \nAcross these topics, my main areas of expertise are: gathering and analyzing qualitative data (i.e. focus group discussions, interviews); developing tools (story telling, questionnaires, training materials); training (creating facilitator notes, training content, facilitating, ToTs); and cultural anthropology (focus of my MA at LSE and central to working in different countries). \nMy work has taken place in challenging, and varied contexts, from a village in Zambia to a refugee camp in Bangladesh, to a conflict zone in Ethiopia. In these places, priorities change rapidly. I thrived across these places, responding to change with flexibility, optimism, and good communication.",
