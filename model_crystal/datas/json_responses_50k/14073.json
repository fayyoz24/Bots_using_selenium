Our world is affected by polarization and because of media bubbles and media distrust, it is getting more difficult to intervene within these echo chambers. The result is that we, people of different cultures, political backgrounds and levels of society, understand each other less. We analyzed this in relation to historical events and how they have been addressed within our society. Solutions and policies to fight against racism and polarization cannot work if there is no deeper understanding of each other's perspectives and backgrounds. We need to get to the core of this problem by connecting, inspiring and educating people to understand each other and thrive.",
