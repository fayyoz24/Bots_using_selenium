    "summary": "Finance is great, and for that reason I choose it as my first degree. I'm also very good at it. Technology though, well it's awesome! What technology can do for business decision making and for engaging with customers is almost magical. I've spent the last 3+ years deploying technology in a finance team to reach an ever growing internal audience with faster and more business relevant information. These people are not just colleagues, they are customers, and my job is to make their jobs easier by providing the right insights in a flexible, dynamic format. \n\nIf I could summarize what working with me is like, it would be:\n- I can talk to the finance people and the IT people \n- I am a dedicated team player\n- I am the calm one\n- I am also the class clown\n- I may sweat a little but I am not afraid of anyone\n- I will find the person I need to get in touch with to get things done\n- I love great ideas but I love executing them even more\n- Life is simple.....we make it complicated (an old German man told me that at a trade fair once, it stuck)\n",
