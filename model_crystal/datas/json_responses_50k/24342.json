This involved the C programming language.  \nThe main purpose of the research was to provide users with unprecedented flexible realtime access to the physical layer from software. In essence, SoNIC implements the physical layer in software to access and control every bit from the physical layer of 10 Gigabit.",

They were welcomed to St. Augustine by Mayor Nancy Shaver. This project is a great way to grow awareness of our institutional history, as well as promoting the rich landscape of cultural attractions that exist in St. Augustine.\nDuring the project, students performed community service at the Woodlawn Cemetery where FMU Founders, Dr. Nathan W. Collier and Sara A. Blocker, are buried. St. Augustine\u2019s first college was a black school known as Florida Normal, later Florida Memorial College. It was located in St. Augustine from 1918 until 1968 when it moved to Miami, Florida where it is currently located. During decades of segregation, Woodlawn Cemetery was the only cemetery where blacks could be buried in St. Augustine. It is a resting place for many African- Americans who served our country valiantly in the armed forces during the 1800s, and the freedom fighters of the Civil Rights struggle.\nIn addition to connecting with FMU\u2019s unique history, students had the opportunity over two days to tour historic sites in St. Augustine related to the history of Florida Memorial, the Civil Rights Movement and the history of Black people in St. Augustine over the centuries. They connected with history that dates back to 1738 to the first legally sanctioned settlement of former slaves, Fort Mose. On the third day of the project, students travelled to Jacksonville, Florida where they learnt about the Clara White Mission and the Historic Bethel Institutional Baptist Church. Both of these sites are historically significant as we connect our students to the rich legacy of leadership, character and service."
