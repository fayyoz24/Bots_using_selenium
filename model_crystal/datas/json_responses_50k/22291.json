One electric driven, and one mechanical (diesel direct) dredge pump (3600kW) can be set up as on a modern hopper dredger. This project was realized in close concert with Transas for VDAB MTC Zeebrugge. The model is equipped with an Integrated Monitoring Control system for the simulated dredge (trail, discharge) process, and a Power Management System mainly to simulate diesel electric drives. Apart of being a dredge model, the set up of systems, strong separation between schematic diagrams, and ECR, MSB control makes this system rather unique.\nOn regular basis I conduct company training sessions on this simulator for junior, and advanced level engineers, and induction courses for superintendents with focus on company procedures, and \u201clessons learned\u201d.\n\n* Development, and implementation, of a (practical) training course program for dredge operators, and deck officers concerning dredge pump maintenance, and related dredge equipment. Attention on correct working procedures, and safety are key factors as the heaviest part during the training to be handled by trainees weighs 8 Ton.\n\n* Tuning the various technical training courses in accordance with company requirements, and needs, all in close cooperation with suppliers, adapted where necessary on level, and content\n\n* Elaborating, and conducting in house training courses for employees of purchase, and (vessel) ERP support departments. Teaching basic marine engineering, and basic equipment knowledge as well for engine room as dredge related subjects.\n\n* Writing (mainly practical orientated), Technical Bulletins for all kinds of technical issues which need clarification to improve efficiency and reliability. This for engine room as dredge equipment related topics as well.",
