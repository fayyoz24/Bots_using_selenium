Upon returning to Czechia, I was\nrecruited both by the Czech and the Austrian branch of this organisation to serve as a referent and tutor. My main task was helping to set up Welcome and Mid-Term Camps, where we welcomed arriving students from all across the world. During these 7 days camps, we worked with the pupils on advancing their interpersonal and development skills. We also made sure they are doing well while staying in the designated country and everything runs smoothly. For each semester, I was assigned to 3-5 pupils as a tutor, helping them with their day-to-day problems or any struggles, that might have occurred throughout the stay."
