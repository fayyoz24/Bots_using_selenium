    "summary": "Combining my prior studies in Strategy from Amsterdam Business School and Entrepreneurship and Innovation from Lund University School of Economics and Management has been a long-held aspiration of mine. Currently I am pursuing my PhD in Management at Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences, where I am conducting research on the intersection of entrepreneurial thinking and strategy development. My ultimate goal is to establish an international career in research, start-up and innovation strategy consulting and entrepreneurship. \n\nI am deeply passionate about the future, innovation and change driven by start-ups that make the world a more creative, connected and inspiring place. I am particularly fascinated by the recognition of new business opportunities and the cognitive processes that underlie the generation of new (creative) business ideas. This curiosity has led me to delve into the field of business psychology, which I have studied through entrepreneurial cognition in both my master\u2019s theses and my ongoing PhD research.\n\nMy areas of interest encompass business strategies and adaptation, innovation management and ambidexterity, entrepreneurship in a broader sense, creativity and opportunity recognition. I am always looking to make new connections and discuss opportunities within (and beyond) my areas of interest. If you share one of my passions and would like to have a conversation, please feel free to connect with me and send me a message.",
