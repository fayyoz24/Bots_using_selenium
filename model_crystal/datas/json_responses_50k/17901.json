    "summary": "I have a Master of Science in Political Science from Leiden University, with a specialisation in Political Legitimacy and Justice. Focused on Political Philosophy, I participated in courses such as \u201cLegitimacy and Political Obligation\u201d, \u201cTransnational Politics of Human Rights\u201d, \u201cContemporary Debates on Justice\u201d, and other general courses involving the main debates in Political Science, International Relations, Public Policy, Ethics, and academic and professional skills.\n\nI also have a Bachelor of Science in Social Work from The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, Brazil. Concerning this academic experience, besides having participated in extracurricular activities (extension and research), I also worked for two years in the public healthcare sector. My main experiences were at the Cl\u00ednicas Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA), where I worked at the Infectology Department with People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and at the Support House, with children and teenagers (from 0 to 18 years of age) who were treated in the Oncology, Hematology, General Pediatrics, and/or Transplants Services of the Hospital.\n\nBefore joining the academic life, I carried out different types of work, having also lived for four and a half years in Italy (at two different times) and one year in England, which provided me with significant personal and professional experience. Leaving my comfort zone strengthened me as a person and made me acquire a new perspective on life, making me a more resilient and independent individual. \n\nI am passionate about political and moral philosophy, correlated with normative ethics, public administration, justice, institutional and administrative processes, and social development matters. My whole academic path was built upon my interests in these fields of study. Social Work is an interdisciplinary social science that aims to understand and intervene in societal/social issues. Likewise, my choice for the master's programme in Political Philosophy was based on my intentions to contribute to social development, aiming to act as a more prepared transforming agent.\nI have always advocated for a transdisciplinary approach, trying to work through a multidimensional lens, for I consider intellectual pluralism to be essential for advancing scientific knowledge in a liberal, plural society. I truly believe in this, and I think it is a valuable perspective to advocate for.",

It was the first opportunity I had to interview patients by myself, and it was also my first contact with such sensitive matters, dealing with diseases and the issue of death, which was very challenging, I must say, especially when it involved children. This experience helped me to cope with the deep emotional situations that often occur within a healthcare setting. I had to learn how to manage my emotions and, at the same time, how to handle patients' (and their family members) emotions.\n\nDuties and responsibilities:\n\n- Social follow-up, conducting interviews with the patients and their relatives;\n- Group meetings with the relatives housed, aiming to give emotional support and to orientate about social services offered by the Hospital and other institutions;\n- Participation in cultural, playful, and pedagogical activities, such as workshops and projects, for the children and teenagers housed;\n- Technical and administrative activities.",
