    "summary": "Dominique Darmon is a lecturer at the Hague University of Applied Sciences. She teaches communications courses such as journalism and media as well as cross cultural communications. \n\nShe is also presently working for the research group Change Management at The Hague University, exploring the role of gossip in organisations in times of change. While many consider it to be negative and harmful, is office gossip not unavoidable? Can it even be managed and harnessed in a positive way? \n\nDominique has over fifteen years of experience working as a television producer and documentary film maker. She speaks fluent English and French, and has a good working knowledge of Dutch.",
