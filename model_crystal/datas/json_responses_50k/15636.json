            "description": "The offshore industry, MARIN and the Universities of Groningen and Delft have worked together successfully in the development of the Volume of Fluid method ComFLOW to study complex free-surface flows around offshore structures. Important aspects have been studied,\nimplemented and validated like: \n \n\n\n\n\u25feSloshing in LNG containment systems\n\u25feAir entrapment during wave impacts (\u201ccushioning\u201d)\n\u25feWave run-up and deck impacts on semi-submersibles and TLPs\n\n\n\n In the most recent Joint Industry Project ComFLOW-3, additional steps were made by including new functionalities to the ComFLOW program, such as: \n \n\n\n\n\u25feModelling of viscous flow effects\n\u25feLocal grid refinement\n\u25feAdvanced wave propagation algorithms\n\u25feAbsorbing boundary conditions for irregular and short crested waves\n\u25feModelling of mooring lines and their influence on floater motions\n\n\n\n During these developments, new questions and demands from participating companies and the offshore industry arose: significant speed-up of algorithms is needed to advance the usability of ComFLOW to more and more complex engineering applications; new and improved functionalities are needed to achieve results in a wider range of applications. The ComMotion JIP aims to meet these demands by developing and improving functionalities that increase computational accuracy and efficiency, and by incorporating new algorithms for interactively moving bodies, hydroelasticity and accurate steep irregular wave generation.\n\nThe joint industry project runs parallel to the identically-named research project ComMotion, which is financed by the Dutch government and supports 2 PhD students, a post-doc and validation model tests. The results of this research project are made available to the ComMotion JIP. ",

The interaction of fluid with an elastic structure is observed in many practical industrial challenges. The focus of my research is to design a stable and robust numerical approch for coupling of fluid and structure models. This problem encounters numerical instabilities under high addd mass to structure mass ratios. Strong coupling covers a full range of interactions.",
