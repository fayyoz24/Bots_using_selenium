    "summary": "Since September 2019 I am working for Kemira in the R&D. It is an adventure where we aim to combine knowledge of the biochemistry and chemistry to tackle the challenges in sludge dewatering using poly-electrolytes (PE). In my role I am mostly traveling, visiting our customers, listening to them, and understand their needs, to be translated further into development.\n\nToday, we are still using fossil fuel based polyacrylamide polymers for the dewatering of sludge, and I am passionate to elevate this to a more sustainable process. Yet challenges remain, for the polymerization process of polyacrylamides remains a relatively cost effective and efficient process, and, still has the lowest impact on the environment in direct comparison to the current alternatives. Today polyelectrolytes are essential for water treatment, thus we can't afford to lose in performance. Still, we should innovate, think and discuss. Only from sketches we can really begin to draw the future.\n\n\u2018Waste to profit\u2019 had been the driving fuel in my MSc program in the widest of its meaning. Where clever utilization of the waste streams resulted in winning the sustainable aviation fuel group challenge by Be-Basic in 2015. This led me to the environmental biotechnology group to complete my thesis  with a focus on producing products from anammox granules from a wastewater treatment plant while also studying their biological nature. Following this path I continued with an internship in Singapore PUB, applying my newly acquired anammox knowledge to study the feasibility of using anammox to remove ammonium from industrial originating waste water (Jurong industrial district) through an activity study. \n\nMy BSc provides me a strong laboratory background on which in the future I would like to further expand, investigating renewable resources, and particularly polymers in the transition towards a bio-based economy.

We won the group challenge, by making clever use of waste-streams to result in a lucrative by-product that was high in demand for civil construction. We used both the lignin and the pure CO2 produced in the fermentation process to make this polymer. I profiled as an out of the box thinker and a commited team worker.\n\nDespite the success of this polymer, showing a sufficient margin to overcome the high CAPEX cost, the project was not feasible, as ethanol, the intermediate product towards kerosene in our process, has a higher value than kerosene.

Further we were interested whether the following digestate could inhibit anammox' capability to remove ammonium. Anammox is used in Singapore at the Changi site for sidestream treatment on domestic waste water. But also the effects of industrial wastewater by itself from Jurong on anammox was still unknown. The primary question was whether Anammox was to see whether anammox could be used in Jurong.  In the project a lot of research and discussions were held in the Changi plant which is known to have reported main stream anammox a few years ago prior to using the DEMON setup. Though this 'event' doesn't occur anymore today, it was great to discuss with the Changi engineers. \n\nSafety is high in regard of PUB, and I appreciate the full opportunity to have seen the implications. Later on, I was asked to host Jurong Safety Day with a colleague. It was inspiring to see a full day of an operational plant being dedicated to the high standards. With less casualties, less families have to suffer in the end!",
