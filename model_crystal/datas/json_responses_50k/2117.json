Verder heb ik project plannen geschreven om donateurs enthousiast te maken om onze projecten te steunen. Verder heb ik het transport geregeld van containers met equipment, machines enz.\nIn Kabul ,Jalalabad , Maidan Wardak en Bamiyan hebben we de containers zelf ontvangen en de machines in de school lokalen geplaatst, opgebouwd en aangesloten. Daarna heb ik de docenten getraind om met de machines op de juiste wijze om te gaan.",
