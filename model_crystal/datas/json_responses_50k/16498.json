    "summary": "I was born in the Netherlands and moved to the States with my family when I was 9 years old where I have resided for most of my life. I am both a Dutch and American citizen (native in both languages), challenge seeker, avid traveler, intrepid adventurer and \u2018global citizen\u2019 constantly looking to balance spiritual and personal growth. I have been to many places around the world ranging from Pakistan, Thailand, Qatar, India, Cambodia and Vietnam to Singapore and Iceland etc. I love backpacking and looking for adventurous volunteer programs (scuba diving anyone?) as well as reading and sharpening my body and mind when I can. I have a special place in my heart for philosophizing, learning psychology and contemplating the universe in my free time. \n\nI returned to the Netherlands to attend Leiden University College after high school at Atlanta International School in the United States. I have worked in social media marketing/design and as a manager at OYA Yoga in Alpharetta most recently. I have learned to instill compassion and discipline in employees and adjust to the consistently new challenges of running a retail/service based business. I had a lot of fun communicating in new ways with new people at Oya. I only ever tell people to do what I have done myself or would be willing to do myself and work from a sense of connectedness and compassion. I enjoy interacting with co-workers and customers with a sense of humor, using whatever opportunities I can to deepen my listening skills. For me, each interaction is about the connection, recognizing the spark in each other.",
