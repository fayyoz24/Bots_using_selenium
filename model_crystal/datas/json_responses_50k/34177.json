Please read further :)\n\n\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddec \ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\uddec \ud83d\udca1\nI dream of a better world with no poverty nor inequalities, triggered by inclusive and responsible economic growth. In line with that, my life purpose is to drive changes that matter, generating positive impact on whomever I interact with. When making decisions, I like taking into consideration the future of our society and the world we and our future generations will still live in; and during the journey, I will always promote a fun environment.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\udddb\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udddc \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0 \ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2666 MBA with over 15 years of B2C & B2B2C International Marketing experience, specialized in the development and implementation of customer-centric (branded) marketing strategies and plans\n\u2666 Passion for driving change via challenging the status-quo throughout the customer decision journey, delivering projects and campaigns that build brand equity and support market penetration & lead generation\n\u2666 Love co-creating relevant solutions together with internal and external stakeholders, supporting my decisions in data analytics\n\u2666 Native Spanish speaker, full professional proficiency in English en ik ben Nederlands aan het leren, to fully embrace my recently acquired Dutch citizenship\n\n\nEven though I'm currently Dutch, I was born and raised in Peru, a Latin-American developing country, so I understand the real pain of poverty and inequalities.
