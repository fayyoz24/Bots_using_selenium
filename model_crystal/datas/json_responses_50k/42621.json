    "summary": "Hello! My name is John-Morgan, and I am open to full-time employment opportunities or freelance assignments. I come from the United States, but I have lived over four years in the Netherlands.\n\nI have shown that I can adapt quickly to new challenges and thrive when pushed out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m originally from a small town in Tennessee, but I completed my bachelor\u2019s degree in Chicago. Following a one-year exchange program in Amsterdam, I returned to the Netherlands to attain my master\u2019s. By forming connections with international peers, I improved my understanding of diverse perspectives and gained better methods for communicating. This allowed me to further implement the skills I developed during university and work experiences. I lived in The Hague for two years during my master\u2019s studies, but I now reside in Utrecht. I am self-employed with an academic tutoring business online, but I also complete varied freelance projects.\n\nI will show that I can excel when presented with an opportunity. Being quality-driven with an attention to detail, I aim to continually improve and cultivate new competencies. I am eager to apply my knowledge in an area of expertise, but I remain open to new ideas and ways of implementation. My academic and entrepreneurial background has developed the necessary qualities to surpass performance standards. In addition, I have volunteered and held leadership positions in various extracurricular organizations that improved my aptitude for interpersonal skills, team management, and collective problem-solving. My current ambition is to establish myself in the Dutch professional world and develop a greater network. I look forward to connecting with you, thanks!",

Value is added to existing research through inclusion of updated studies and utilization of estimation techniques to limit bias. Findings for post-release employment outcomes support a significant, positive effect from participation in correctional education. Program-type comparisons of academic and vocational programs provide less insight. Reliability of results is supported by robust inclusion criteria; test and correction for publication bias supports validity. Policy recommendations and suggestions for further research conclude.",

During the summer of 2016, I joined a group with the goal of changing the consumption habits of American consumers to put a higher emphasis on American made products. Our team executed secondary research to recognize the factors influencing domestic production and consumption, then presented an argument against current trends. We also developed a tangible solution to benefit retail shoppers in the form of a location-based mobile application for finding nearby Made in USA products. I was very interested in the topic and proposed solution, so I decided to continue with this project in a second iteration. In Spring 2017, I worked with a new group of peers to complete primary research regarding our project, further refine our application interface, and develop new ways of reaching consumers. Our project received several awards at the annual program showcase.",
