Employees fear reprimands and other consequences when failures are revealed. However, early literature shows the importance of failures at work, and the impact of failures on innovation. This empirical study consisting of 126 employees investigated the relationship between failure at work and learning behavior, with the influence of the traits regulatory focus and goal orientation. Hypothesized was that failure at work would only lead to learning behavior when promotion focus or learning goal orientation was high. Both hypotheses were rejected. The unexpected findings were that promotion focus and learning goal orientation have a moderating effect, but negative. The relationship between failure at work and learning behavior deteriorates as either promotion focus or learning goal orientation increases. The explained variance of the moderators was rather low, so future research should study other factors that might influence the relationship. ",

I'm the first point of contact for the business, especially now our Product Owner role is temporarily vacant.\nA new subject I'm currently working on is the Payroll integration in Workday. Before Go-Live and during 2020-2021 the execution of the payroll integration lay with our implementation partner. However, since the start of 2022 the responsibility of this subject has shifted to me. If the third-party company cannot process the incoming changes and generates errors in the logfile, I conduct a investigation of the PECI file and the changes entered for the worker(s).\n\nLarge projects in 2022 and future:\n> Design and configuration of the Merit 2023, with the emphasis on the change occurring in Talent & Performance. Merit adjustment is in 2023 solely based on the scores earned during the Performance cycles. No longer any input from the managers needed, except during the employee reviews.\n> Implementation of the employer's declaration in Workday. RaaS report built that automatically generates when a request has been made by the worker. The template is created in BIRT.\n> Implementation of the Wage Tax Statement created in BIRT, just like the employer's declaration mentioned above.\n\nWorkday Certifications:\n> PRO HCM Module\n> PRO Compensation Module\n> PRO Recruiting Module\n\nSingle courses:\n> Report Designer (BIRT)\n> Configurable Security",

The main focus of my expertise lies with HCM Core, Compensation, Recruitment, Talent & Performance, Expenses and Security administration.\n\nDuring the design phase of a process or a change request I give my take on the subject and advise the business on the technical aspect of Workday. Sometimes a particular design is not feasible within the boundaries of the system, whereafter it is my responsibilty to come up with a creative workaround. \n\nLarge projects in 2020-2021:\n> Data migration between SAP and Workday for the 2021 Go-Live of Workday. It entailed gathering all the necessary worker data from SAP and upload it into Workday through Data Gathering Workbooks (DGW) and Enterprise Integration Builds (EIB). \n> The Go-Live of Talent & Performance module for the midyear  and endyear employee reviews. Configurated the process and related dashboards. \n> Merger of Stedin and DNWG. Lead on the data upload part in Workday through EIB. Responsible for the build of the new compensation plans, custom organizations and Workday accounts. For the data catch up after the initial loads, I created a tool in Microsoft Excel that automatically assigns the correct staffing process for the worker based on all the data entered in DNWG SAP after the benchmark date. This made the data catchup part significantly easier for the business and kept the quality of the data migration high versus manually submitting changes.\n> Configuration of the Merit 2022, in combination with Talent & Performance.
