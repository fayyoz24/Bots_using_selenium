    "summary": "Specialismen: (Interim) Management, Operations, Sales, (Digital) Marketing, Experiential Marketing, Operational Marketing, People skills, Leadership, Publishing, Logistics, Business Organisation, B2B2C Business, Structuring financially, Business Coaching and Investing.\n\nAt the age of 25  I started my own company Bananas: an experiential marketing agency specialized in sampling with big clients like The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Perfetti van Melle. After more than 10 years I sold the company. My company was a solid operational marketing enterprise with 50 people permanently employed and about 1.000 people temporarily employed. The company had a strong commercial unit experienced in concepting and client contact and an operational unit which focused on warehouse activities and staff planning and execution. Business was B2B2C oriented. Turnover level 5 million euros.\nAfter Bananas I cofounded two soccer magazines; Ajax magazine 1900 and single theme magazine 90 Minutes. These magazines were sold to publishing house New Skool Media. After this adventure I coached several entrepreneurs, had an interim job at the social enterprise WakaWaka, worked as MD of influencer marketing agency 3sixtyfive and most recent as COO of scale-up and fintech company BOTS.\n\nTo be a successful business owner you have to be ambitious, results driven, repeatedly prove the ability to achieve targets through innovative strategies and create an energetic and determined workforce to achieve success. \n\nI am a hands-on manager, builder who is used to work with international clients and partners. I can construct, negotiate and set up deals and partnerships. Like to coach and expand teams, getting the most out of people. I combine quick business sense and empathy.\n\nCurrently I'm active as an Investor and advisor (Operations, Strategy advice, Board dynamics, Fundraising) for (tech) companies.",
