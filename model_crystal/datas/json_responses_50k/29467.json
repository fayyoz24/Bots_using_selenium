The brief from TUI was to \u2018create a dynamic, open working environment where staff can easily meet and work together\u2019.\n\nIn order to achieve this and open up the interior of the building, open staircases were placed between the floors. On the ground floor, a multifunctional atrium was created, surrounded by rooms where people can have lunch, work and meet.\n\nOn the upper floors, a fully open-plan working environment was created, with break-out zones distributed throughout, where people can meet for a cup of coffee, hold informal meetings, just to get away from their desk or to make use of the printing and copying facilities.\n\nEverywhere you look, it is clear you are in the world of TUI. Colour, material and products have been chosen to emphasize the travel theme. Signage and visuals from the travel world are also found throughout the building, which fully immerses the occupants in the TUI \u2013holiday\u2013 atmosphere.",

Important is that the employees of the IT company should be able to easily work/sit together in different teams and not be restricted by the interior of the office. At first sight it might be confusing but after all it should form a logical and natural whole.\n\nWith all these ingredients we have designed an interior in which nothing, except the reception unit at the entrance, is standing straight. Where elevated floors and shielding elements ensure that teams can easily sit and work together. With various team rooms where you can easily lean back in a comfortable chair or have a stand up meeting in another one.\nThe use of oak, steel, glass and color accents has given the office a robust character. Plants and styling elements provide variety and give the office a homely sphere.\nA nice advantage was that we have revitalised the office building Blaak16 and therefore were well familiar with all ins and outs of the building.",

And that was not the only culture change: most employees were also moving from private offices to an open plan. DZAP designed an interior that would ease the transition to the open plan by making it smaller and more intimate, in the virtual sense. This effect was accentuated by centrally located pavilions. But the piece de resistance of the office was the Grand Caf\u00e9 Restaurant that takes you to a completely different world, far away from work and the office. Part of this is achieved with the Persian carpet tablecloths.",

The goal of the relocation: better communication between the units and greater synergy. For this integration, DZAP developed the work concept, designed the interior and carried out the execution as general contractor.\n\nDue to the success of the office, it more and more was used as a global example and as a central meeting hub for international meetings.
