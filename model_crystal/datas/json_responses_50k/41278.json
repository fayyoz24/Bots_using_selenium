    "summary": "I am a passionate and committed Communication and Project Management Specialist trained in Cameroon and the Netherlands (WUR) the world\u2019s leading Agricultural University. I work to improve the livelihoods of underprivileged communities and assist prospective African agribusinesses and students develop skills and linkages with prospective European investors and educational institutions. From my work experiences in the private sector and non-governmental organisations, I have developed better marketing & communication, project management, trade facilitation, and negotiation competencies, and coupled with my know-how about EU regulations on food safety from WUR as well as my practical experience, I can safely bridge the gap between  Africa and Europe in international trade in a sustainable manner.  \n\nRealising that adequate and timely information on opportunities plus technology is a major player in profitable decision-making, but often lacked by African businesses, my passion is to drive this area by making relevant information available to African agribusinesses with a focus on women small-scale farmer cooperatives that have little or no information about external markets & funding, and students. This is intended to be a win-win for all parties.\n\nAs a co-founder & CEO of EuroAfri Link (EAL) http://euroafrilink.com/, our core service is to support European food buyers in their African sourcing and African exporters entering international markets like the EU. For I have a strong belief that promoting trade improves the livelihoods of communities in Africa, especially women, and the positioning of African agribusiness that have more women entrepreneurs than men. \n\nWith EAL, I am confident that Africans can benefit from trade (ready market) for their produce, profitable areas for funding agri-projects, and counseling for further studies in European accredited universities. Europeans would benefit from reliable & trustworthy suppliers, fresh quality agri-produce; profit from investment drives, and the increased entrance of high-caliber students into their universities.",
