All policies and procedures were enforced to ensure excellent customer service was provided and to maximize the profit and loss performance of the store.  Proper procedures were followed for cash transactions and bank deposits.  I directly supervised service center and store associates and carried out supervisory responsibilities in accordance with company policies and applicable laws.  I set up appointments for vehicle repairs, wrote work orders and gave customers estimates for recommended repairs.  I was responsible for interviewing, hiring, training, directing, rewarding and disciplining associates; appraising associate performance; and resolving complaints.  Weekly and monthly reports were completed and sent into the corporate office.  I scheduled the weekly associate work schedules.  Merchandise was set up according to plan-o-grams received from the corporate office.  Weekly sales ads and price changes were executed.  Deliveries were received from venders and corporate distribution centers.  The store and service center were prepared for physical inventory by making sure the merchandise on the sales floor and in the stock room was in order and easy to access.",
