    "summary": "I work as a Assistant Professor (UD1, with tenure-track) at the Information Technology group (INF), Wageningen University. My research is focused on Smart Energy Systems and Energy Informatics.  I am passionate about sustainable energy transition and believe in the key role digitalization plays in enabling that. From 2012 to 2016, I did my PhD (Cum-Laude) at the Statistical Analysis of Networks and Systems (SANS) research group, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC, BarcelonaTech) in Spain. From 2016 to 2020, I was a postdoc at the Energy & Resources group, Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, The Netherlands. This gave me a unique experience in combining my background in computer engineering with power network and energy systems, and creating new research contributions, with a large focus on the end-user side. I have worked on several Dutch and European research projects in the area of smart grids, including smart energy systems design, local energy communities and electricity markets, solar energy forecasting and smart integration of distributed energy resources, such as batteries and electric cars, all with an emphasis on using ICT platforms, modeling, optimization, and artificial intelligence.",

            "description": "The energy production landscape is being reshaped by distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar PV panels, electric vehicles, battery energy storage and charging stations. The rapid deployment of these DER calls for novel management schemes that can exploit the maximum economic and environmental potential of these resources, empower their end-users in a collaborative manner and at the same time guarantee grid reliability.\nThe B-DER project will develop a platform to enable peer-to-peer energy transactions between DER, allowing households, with energy generation capabilities, to trade energy in a distributed, optimal, verifiable and transparent fashion. To achieve this mission, the project partners will develop a novel optimization algorithm that allows households to minimize their electricity cost and maximize the use of locally generated PV energy while at the same time respecting the LV-grid constraints and losses.\nTo enable secure and verifiable decentralized energy transactions between the involved agents, the project will implement the optimization algorithm on a blockchain-smart contract architecture. The project assesses the technical and economic potential of the developed platform using actual data of households\u2019 demand and PV generation profiles, as well as EV charging stations demand in a residential neighborhood in Amsterdam. The socio-economic and regulatory issues of peer to peer and community based markets will also be studied in this project.",

It develops an innovative technical platform for participatory energy management, fuelled by novel analytics, visualisation and gamification techniques. Using energy monitors, electricity consumption and solar Photovoltaics energy production data in households is collected and analyzed, and information, tips and feedback are provided to each individual household using mobile and web applications. The PARENT project operates across three European cities: Amsterdam (Netherlands), Bergen (Norway) and Brussels (Belgium). \nIn Amsterdam, the \"Borneo-Eiland Prosumers Community\" pilot installation aims to allow prosumers to have better insight of their electricity consumption and solar energy production, get personalized tips, engage with neighbors to reduce interaction with the electricity grid, and build an energy independent community. The pilot was launched in March 2017 targeting 30 households in the East of Amsterdam and is called \"East Harbour Prosumers Community\". The pilot is lead and executed by Utrecht University and Resourcefully.
