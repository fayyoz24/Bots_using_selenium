    "summary": "Synthetic chemistry | chemical biology | synthetic biology\n\nI am a chemistry PhD student with experience in synthetic biology. Currently exploring the field of chemical biology where synthetic chemistry and molecular biology meet.\n\nMy PhD project within the SweetCrosstalk ITN has special interest towards synthesis and manipulation of complex mucin glycans in the human gut. The primary goal is to design and synthesize smart molecular probes in order to study the interactions between these glycans and the gut microbiota, and how they may have effects on human health. \n\nIn general, I\u2019m fascinated by biocatalysis, biomimetic chemistry and artificial enzymes. I believe that nature is the greatest source of inspiration, and it\u2019s imperative that we learn from it and strive to surpass it.\n\nLove challenges and always look forward to them.",

Phosphostore uses genetically-modified bacteria that can accumulate phosphate from wastewater in protein-based microcompartments for future recycling. In our project, we expressed Eut (Ethanolamine utilisation) bacterial microcompartments and a polyphosphate kinase (PPK) enzyme with a Pdu (1,2-propanediol utilisation) localization tag. This enables the encapsulation of the PPK enzyme within the microcompartment, allowing the formation of polyphosphate chains to be built and stored safely from degradation by endogenous exopolyphosphatase (PPX).",
