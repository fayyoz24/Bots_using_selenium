My goal is to enable organisations to make well-informed and evidence-based decisions that are holistic and focus on the long term. \n\nDuring my time in academia, I combined fieldwork with state-of-the-art statistical techniques to study the evolution of sociality in birds, mammals, and fish. \n\nMy other interests include effective altruism, history and politics.",

By increasing our understanding of such processes, we were able to forecast the group dynamics and population persistence of meerkats in response to global climate change.",

I collected field data on the island of Cousin (Seychelles) and the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika (Zambia) and used experiments and state-of-the-art statistical techniques to infer relationships between ecology, life-history traits, and behaviour. This research resulted in multiple publications in high-impact journals and offered several new insights into the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates that were previously underappreciated. \n\nI also engaged in the supervision of students, presented my work at several scientific conferences, and provided (paid) statistical guidance and advice to MSc and Ph.D. students.",
