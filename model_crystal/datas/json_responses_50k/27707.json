Together with 9 other students we set out to design a True High-Efficiency Commercial Aircraft. Our first challenge was defining what True High-Efficiency stands for, is it fuel burned per passenger, per passenger per kilometer or energy used during the entire life cycle including production of the aircraft. These aspects were investigated and our team formulated our own definition of True High-Efficiency. Next we started designing our aircraft which at the end resulted in Hydrogen fueled aircraft with next generation open rotor engines.\n\nThe entire project was executed in professional manner with the aim of emulating a real working environment as seen in industry. This was done by following a strict schedule and assigning roles such as Project manager, systems engineer, secretary, etc.",
