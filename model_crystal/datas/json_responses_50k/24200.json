The inhabitant have settled their homes in the hillsides of high slope and is located on an area of unstable soils and high risk of loose material sliding along the trails where this could detach and affect homes lower; There also slope instability due to the lack of protection and the type of soil could fall by gravity.\n\nThe uptown of that area has an ecosystem of green hills, which is affected due to the rapid growth of land invasions, which have altered and reducing the quality of life of these people, directly impacting the natural ecosystem which decreases daily.\n\nThe Implementation\u00b4 s project will undertake for that Municipallity through a pilot program, which will initially consist of  afforestation with 2000 trees of native species in the areas currently limit the hills and Human Settlement , to prevent its expansion, which will lead to environmental benefits for the people and the ecosystem ; for execution is counted with a participation plan and sensitization of the people. Also, watering is done through the implementation of a system-catchers.",

The objective of this paper is to develop a system of equations to estimate the volume net of wood of the mahogany trees, located in Amazonian forests in Madre de Dios, using variables easily obtained in standing trees. To determine the volume equations were made regression analysis grounded in the Method of Least Squares for each of the models; the failed models were discarded, and the models suitable were weighted with different factors, building new models of equations that underwent weighted regression analysis; the resulting were compared by Furnival index. Finally, the equation more accurately estimating the volume was obtained, being this: V = 0.16073 to 0.01130 dh + d + 0.00039772 0.00022887 0.00006968 d2 + d 2hq5qpc.. On the other hand, the Form Factor per individual was calculated, concluding that form factors are higher than those recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture.",
