These defects can be formed during the detector manufacture or due to the effect of radiation in space developing deep level traps. Traps capture and release the signal carriers (e.g. photoelectrons) following an exponential decay process with characteristic time constants that depend on the nature of the defect itself often referred to as trap species. Radiation-induced traps in the silicon lattice of CCDs can endanger end-of-life performance of space missions if not properly taken into account in the spacecraft design, device operation, and data processing. Traps in MCT are much less understood and studied than in Silicon.\nThe key objective of this traineeship opportunity was to bridge the gap in knowledge between traps in MCT and Silicon. On the way of this study was done several researches to create a model and to develop an instrumentation set-up system to characterize the different species of traps and their performance effects on ALFA MCT detectors. Correlated some previous persistence (traps are also at the origin of this undesired effect) and dark current data was also done to predict the performance of this HgCdTe semiconductor detectors and compare to CCD performances for optical Future Science Missions.\n- Development of an optical configuration to measure the quantum efficiency on MCT for different wavelengths to performing a cryogenic system for ARIEL future mission.\n- Performance characterization of MCT detectors to support EUCLID future mission.",

To carry-out this study several sets of measurements were performed under a cyclotron proton beam, in the energy range from 2 MeV to 14 MeV, at ICNAS (Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Nucleares Aplicadas \u00e0 Sa\u00fade) cyclotron at the Coimbra University, under a proton beam with a maximum current of ~150 mA (~9.4x1014 protons/s). The CdTe detector was previously characterized in laboratory, in particular its leakage currents, \u03bc\u03c4, energy resolution and peak channels under several gamma-ray sources (57Co, 22Na, 137Cs, 241Am,133Ba, 60Co etc). This project that I am in is integrated in the Research Group \u2013 LIP Space Instrumentation for Astrophysics Group (i-Astro) of Coimbra (or Laboratory of Experimental Physics of High Energies and Associated Instrumentation).",
