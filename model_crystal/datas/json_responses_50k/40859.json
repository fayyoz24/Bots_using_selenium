    "summary": "Blessed with a multi-lingual and loving family whilst growing up in The Netherlands, I've always had a great love for languages, cross-cultural interaction and communication, understanding others, and seeing opportunities to introduce the right people to each other and trade knowledge, goods, and services.\n\nMy professional career was shaped by working my dream job at the Dutch Embassy in Prague and exploring the world of hospitality from the 'blue' side @ Booking.com.\n\nAs a founding father of Mews, which quickly grew to travel- and fintech's new-age industry leader, I had the challenging pleasure of contracting, training, supporting and account managing our clients and partners in the early days. Signing 100+ clients, implementing over 100 more, and conducting countless consultation projects to clients and our teams along the way.\n\n2019 marked my return to The Netherlands to expand Mews in the Benelux and set the foundation for our family life. Inspiring Mewsers, with an emphasis on the Benelux commercial team, brought great joy and resulted in becoming salesperson of the year.\nIn 2020, it was my great pleasure to coach the brilliant Winner Hotel Software team - Mews' first-ever acquisition of another company.\n\nOver the years, I gained an incredible network of (not only) hospitality professionals and enthusiasts. \nIt has become my mission to inspire colleagues, clients, non-clients, business partners, and my family with new ideas and business opportunities.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, I embarked on multiple new journeys when founding Happy Inspirer.\nAsides from a loving family life, these journeys include adding my value to industry-leading pricing app RoomPriceGenie, consulting independent hoteliers, and expanding our family business.\n\n\"To continuously learn, give & add value to all aspects of life are the key to a happy life.\"\nAnd it is my great pleasure to pave the way to happiness together with you!",

And I've made it my personal mission to enable the power of Pricing with all hoteliers that are keen to generate more income and enhance their daily life.\n\nAutomated Pricing is an element everyone should get started with. It\u2019s not a luxury anymore; it is absolutely essential. And channeling its essence through Partners is the fastest way to spread the word.\n\nThe status quo of Partnerships in hospitality tech is a high focus on \u2018connecting with Partners\u2019 and a rather low focus on generating actual business & income.\nMy approach to business is very commercial and I challenge this status quo with a \"Less bureaucracy, more business\" approach.\n\nPartnerships play a key role in scaling businesses together and must be approached with the goal to truly help our Partners and jointly acquire new revenue.\n\nI specialize in enabling RoomPriceGenie's Partners to educate their audience and acquire new business together by truly joining forces.",

Not only did the majority of Winner users want to migrate as soon as possible during the COVID madness, but the increased efficiency of internal operations, automation in guest communication, and increase in additional revenue streams was flabbergasting!\n\nAside from this, I signed Mews' largest sales deal to date: The Student Hotel group.\nThis was the longest & intense, and certainly the most rewarding, project in my sales days. \nA huge 'Thank you' to all involved!\n\nKey projects I worked on at this time were, among others:\n- Return on Investment calculator (Yes, Mews is not the cheapest platform on the market. And once you calculate how much value it adds, you're amazed by the returns you'll make).\n- Student accommodation & Hybrid accommodation providers.",
