            "description": "A semantic segmentation neural network for autonomous driving was investigated using Caffe. The base architecture was AlexNet, which was later converted into a fully convolutional network. The network was trained on the Synthia dataset and the effects of modifying the architecture with skip layers was analyzed. Skip locations were varied to determine the impact on pixel-level classification error. The best performance was achieved using two skip layers. It increased the per pixel accuracy by approximately 1.5% as well as making the segmentation less coarse. The skip network has the benefit of incorporating finer details from the weak classification of a shallow network into the deep network's superior classification.",

The transportation effort required is solved using a fleet of helicopters, which by passenger volume, constitutes one of the largest non-military helicopter operations in the world. Inspired by the complexity and magnitude of this operation a case study is conducted, which presents a model for finding the optimal route and number of helicopters for an oil platform transportation problem. This is achieved by solving a constrained multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) using a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) model. Furthermore, the helicopters were constrained on range and number of stops to resemble a more realistic scenario.",
