    "summary": "Training Officer & Organizer at the Socialist Party (SP). I coach and train local chapters within our party in order for them to strengthen their work in the city council and on the streets. I also give a variety of trainings to (aspiring) city council members and volunteers. Within all of this, I am specialised in community organizing. I do a lot of community organizing myself and train other people in how to successfully organize people around their shared interests.\n\nI have a ever lasting commitment to grass-root mobilization and empowerment, something I also implemented through my studies in History and Genocide Studies, as well as in my various internships and traineeships in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding.",
