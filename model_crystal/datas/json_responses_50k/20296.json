The implementation of the hospitality concept Services4 has been the spearpoint during my internship. (Implementation date: 8 March 2013)\n\nThe hospitality mind-set takes in regard the needs of all stakeholders of both the property manager as that of the objects, its added value creates marketability. My thesis takes in account the current economic fluctuations in the real estate industry and underpins why the change in orientation will be of added value in the future.\n\nSuccesses: development Services4, negotiation strategies, attainment of objects, creation of first hospitality multi-functional object 'The Calypso' in Rotterdam.",
