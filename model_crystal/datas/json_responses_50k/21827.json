We created a platform to bring together artists and art historians, and encourage collaboration. We developed exhibitions with young promising artists, gave lectures and organised artist interviews for events. From September 2017 to January 2018 we were located at a temporary project space in a former flower shop (Rembrandt van Rijnstraat Groningen) that functioned as a working space where artists were invited to develop new work specifically for the wonderful yet odd space. Wouter van der Laan created an installation \"Mesh\" wherein he used elements he found during his investigation into the history of the space and neighbourhood. Marieke Opgelder created a video about the making process of her micro-stich embroideries and created wall paintings on the tiles of the exhibition space. Dragan Glamo\u010di\u0107 showed many of his entertaining mechanical sculptures.  \n\nThe initiative started when the curators duo decided to organise a group exhibition in their Livingroom. While the exhibition was meant to merely occupy the Livingroom, the project soon spread into the other spaces: with a site-specific installation in the kitchen cabinets, sculptures in the garden and video projections in the bedroom. For the most recent exhibition the Livingallery returned to the private exhibition space of their home, this time the hallway. \n\nTo lean and see more about the Livingallery see the links below:",

I managed the project almost independently and acted as the main curator, in collaboration with prof. dr. Andreas Bl\u00fchm and Reiner Opoku, the artist\u2019s agent. As project manager I coordinated the logistics as well as diverse activities around the exhibition, from press to education. In my function I acted as the main liaison with the staff of David LaChapelle\u2019s Studio. \n\nI conducted research for the acquisition of Seismic Shift, resulting in a successful fund application for the Vereniging Rembrandt and the publication \u201cSeismic Shift. With David LaChapelle in the Museum\u201d, written together with prof. dr. Andreas Bl\u00fchm. I wrote all exhibition texts and an essay based on an interview with David LaChapelle for the Groninger Museum Magazine. \n\nPublic talks related to the David LaChapelle exhibition included an interview with the artist during the press conference, the participation in a panel discussion about female nudity in art at the Centrum Beeldende Kunst Groningen (Centre for Visual Arts), a presentation for the members of the Groninger Museum and a Talkshow by Kunstpot during the Groninger Museumnacht. \n\nIn addition to the work for the exhibition I assisted prof. dr. Andreas Bl\u00fchm with the course Museums: Then and Now at the University of Groningen.\n\nSee an interview about working at the museum and the exhibition publication below.",
