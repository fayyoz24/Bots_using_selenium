    "summary": "I\u2019m a connector by nature, an advocate for financial literacy, microfinance, inclusion, and an entrepreneur with more than 20 years of experience in international corporate business and finance across multiple industries and disciplines.\n \nPassionate about business and financial skills as an enabler to help others connect the dots with new perspectives and to bring structure and clarity. In my work, I combine first-class analytical skills with a creative and problem-solving mindset. In addition, I help to find solutions to the challenges that people, and businesses encounter in today's modern complex world, so that they can turn crises into entrepreneurial opportunities.\n\nMy mission is to bring hands-on financial and business skills to underrepresented and sustainability-driven entrepreneurs, combining my experience in corporate business and finance, tech start-up, and social entrepreneurship industries.\n\nHelping others advance on their entrepreneurial journey is how I bring value from the experience that I have gained through years of working in corporate business and finance and getting involved in the Dutch start-up ecosystem, including building my own technology start-up. In the most recent years, I'm working towards adding greater social impact. On my explorative path of lifelong learning, I continue to expand my toolbox and aspire to share that as a mentor and adviser in a constructive manner.\n \nIn life and business, I follow the saying, when there is a crisis, look for the opportunity. Let's connect and explore opportunities for how we can scale and use digital access and EdTech to empower more people with entrepreneurial skills that can help them build a better future!",
