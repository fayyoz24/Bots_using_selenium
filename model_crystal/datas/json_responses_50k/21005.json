However, incorporating behavioral data has shown promising results for other natural language processing tasks. Therefore, we leverage behavioral information for authorship attribution. As such, we not only analyze what text was created, but also how it was created. More specifically, we predict the post-editors of sentences that were automatically translated from English to Italian. We compare the performance of multiple models and find that a Random Forest is the most effective approach, achieving an accuracy of 85% when using both linguistic and logging (including behavioral) features. The most informative features for predicting the post-editors are behavioral data, confirming our expectations.",

            "description": "Semantic tagging is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing(NLP) and many algorithms have been proposed to improve the tagging accuracy for further application. How\nto find the most effective and cheapest algorithm remains to be answered. Li et al. (2020) has found that the model selection for this task is highly dependent on the data size, label ratio and label cleanliness. Simple linear model can outperform the deep learning models if the data is imbalanced or is very large. Based on their finding, the purpose of this study is, therefore, to examine whether the more \u2018complex\u2019 sequence models would surpass the \u2018simple\u2019 linear models given a clean, small, but highly imbalanced data set. By experimenting with 3 linear classifiers (i.e., Decision Tree, SVM,\nand Random Forest) and two sequential models (TnT (Second-order Markov chain model) and CRF), we found that with appropriate features, the linear classifier could reach the same robust performance as the sequence model with the accuracy reaching 0.95. However, if the sequential information was removed from the training process, the accuracy of the linear model would drop by 0.04, while that of the CRF model would remain the same. The finding of this paper is expected to provide practical guidance for model selection in semantic tagging or even more general sequence tagging tasks.",

For this purpose the mouse tracking method can be used and Reaction Times (RT), Maximum Deviation (MD) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) can be analyzed. As no similar research for Russian language was conducted, we expect the results to be comparable with Boylan et al. (2012) study.",
