    "summary": "\"The greatest device for more creativity and innovation... is a curious mind!\"\n\nAs a Chemical Analyst at SGS, I apply my analytical and physical chemistry expertise to provide reliable and accurate testing services for various industries. With a PhD in Physical Chemistry and over 10 years of laboratory experience, I have a strong background in designing and synthesizing DNA-based constructs, conducting measurements using various techniques, and analyzing data using advanced software.\n\nI am passionate about research, innovation, and problem-solving, and I enjoy working in a collaborative and dynamic environment where I can learn new skills and share my knowledge. I have successfully completed multiple research projects at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich in Germany, where I also trained and mentored other team members and contributed to scientific publications. I am always eager to explore new challenges and opportunities in the field of chemistry, biochemistry and related disciplines. Recently, I moved to the Netherlands, where I am improving my Dutch language skills and learning more about the local chemistry sector. I am excited to leverage my laboratory, career, and language skills at SGS and deliver high-quality results for our clients.",
