I believe when we acknowledge we know nothing and begin to non-judgmentally observe the world around us, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of possibilities.\n\nIn today\u2019s increasingly complex and interconnected world, I see systems thinking and an interdisciplinary perspective as critical for overcoming challenges. I aim to utilize these techniques and bring an open, holistic approach to solve problems in my work.",
