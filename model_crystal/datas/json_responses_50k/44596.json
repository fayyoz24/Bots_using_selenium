Some applied projects that I have worked on include developing compliant electrical connections for folding solar panels and writing an application for origami-inspired engineering design. \n\nMy research has focused on modeling origami-based mechanism kinematics and stiffness and has been published in several venues. Finite-element simulation of mechanical behavior such as buckling, vibration and large-deflection using ANSYS has been an important component of my work. This simulation experience has been supported by several advanced classes in finite-element theory, design and simulation. Work in these classes culminated in my developing a non-linear finite element code in Python.",

This technology allows multiple people to collaboratively construct complicated parts quickly and eliminate bottlenecks in 3D part modeling. Initially, I developed test cases that could be used to evaluate the capabilities of the software and ensure that any bugs in its implementation were found and corrected. Work in this phase also included creating demos of the software for project sponsors, including Ford and Boeing. \n\nLater, I helped develop the software that stored, transmitted and synchronized features between different CAD users. These components were written in C#, giving me significant opportunities to enhance my code-writing skills. I also supported project progress by assisting in the debugging process.",

Since this project was much more conceptual, my work in this area involved analysis of different concepts for the deployable structure. Different concepts were evaluated and with the support of other students, plans were made to construct prototypes for testing.\n\nA final contribution I made was to design flight hardware for the NASA RainCube mission launching in March, 2018. Specifically, I designed a housing for electronic components which successfully met requirements for weight, simplicity and radiation shielding.",
