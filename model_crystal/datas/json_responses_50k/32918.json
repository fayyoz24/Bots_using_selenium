    "summary": "ABOUT ME\nA creative, ambitious, studious and solution-oriented graduated BSc Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences student TU Delft with a deeply rooted passion for Architecture and the Built Environment. I have gained a strong eye for both visuals and perspectives by starting with photography, one of my biggest hobbies, when I was still a kid. I express my creativity in the form of architectural and graphic design.\n\nEDUCATION & EXPERIENCE\nOver the years, I've gained a great understanding of both Dutch Architecture and Urban-design during my BSc Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences at the TU Delft. Further on, being an Architectural City Guide in Rotterdam grants me the opportunity to both share and expand this knowledge. \nI've completed the multidisciplinary LDE (Leiden-Delft-Erasmus) African Dynamics Minor as part of my Bachelor in Architecture to gain a better understanding of the African continent in order to seek solutions on important Architectural and Urban-challenges that Africa, as well as other emerging economies, are facing.\n\nVISION\nArchitecture is such a powerful profession since it shapes the structures we live, work and recreate in. I guess one could say that (even) quality of life is partly defined by architecture. Through architecture, I aspire to be part of the positive change our world needs. My designs are always in line with the needs of the physical and social context, topped-up with a slice of creativity.",

It aims to shine light on Rotterdam\u2019s architecture and creates awareness about important challenges that the Built Environment is facing, such as urbanization and climate change.\n\nIn 2023, the theme of the festival was \u2018de natte stad\u2019, which is Dutch for \u2018the liquid city\u2019. The festival heart was located in De Maashaven, a harbor-area in Rotterdam-South. This harbor will soon become home of the Nelson Mandelapark. The festival consisted out of three floating parts, each reflecting a different identity of the future park.\n\nMy tasks as a volunteer: scanning tickets, welcoming guests, providing information, stimulating dialogues"
