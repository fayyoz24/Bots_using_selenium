    "summary": "Hi! I'm Andrew and I am a Data Steward in the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nIn this capacity, I spend much of my time liaising with researchers and support staff in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology (CAOS) and the Centre for Science & Technology Studies (CWTS) to address any and all Research Data Management needs \u2013 from assisting in drafting Data Management Plans, to choosing long-term data storage/archiving, assembling Publication Packages, or any number of other facets of RDM that social science researchers encounter in their work.\n\nAdditionally, I also work closely with my team of Privacy, Security, and Data Management experts in our faculty, as well as with colleagues at Leiden's Center for Digital Scholarship, to develop resources and tooling that will assist researchers and fellow RDM professionals alike in navigating the rapidly shifting and sometimes daunting landscape of new policies, protocols, and ever more forms to fill out.\n \nIn my previous lives, I've been a Research Data Coordinator in academic cancer medicine (NYC, US); completed a doctoral degree in sociology with a concentration in social studies of medicine (McGill University, CA); and worked as a (sometimes-competitive) oyster shucker in the great state of Maine. I've also held a couple of postdoctoral fellowships (University of Washington, USA & Radboud University, NL), where I was studying and working alongside sociotechnical infrastructure development projects, predominantly in the field of translational science & medicine. \n\nIt is here that I gained a keen appreciation for the promises, difficulties, and overall hard work it takes to implement concepts like Open Science and the FAIR Data Principles in everyday research practices \u2013 both in the fields that I have studied, but also in my own work as an ethnographer of knowledge infrastructures. And it was an interest in confronting these challenges as an RDM practitioner, where I could help researchers and policymakers make sense of each others' distinct epistemologies (or whatever you call it), that led me to my current work as a Data Steward.\n\nBeyond these pursuits, I love reading novels on my morning commute to work, watching tennis in the evenings, accumulating way more LPs than I'll ever have the time to listen carefully to, and seeking out lighthouses in distant corners of the world with the partner of my dreams and the kid for whom we share responsibility.",

Personal health environments (PGOs) have been designed for this: these are digital platforms for the safe online exchange of personal health data between a healthcare organization and a citizen. PGOs would give citizens the opportunity to decide for themselves with whom they would and would not like to share their health data, which in turn would lead to better health outcomes and tailored care. At the same time, it is a challenge for the government and technology designers to design PGOs that are suitable for people with different backgrounds and (digital) skills.\n\nWith this research we want to map out how different user groups view PGOs; what they expect from such a platform; and what user needs they have. The aim of this research is to provide a clear overview of the wishes and needs of different user types. This helps policymakers and designers to develop an accessible PGO that can be used widely.\n\nDuring this research, special attention is paid to the following user groups: citizens with and without chronic illness, including the elderly. Representatives of these groups are invited to a workshop dedicated to their target audience. In addition, we invite policymakers, PGO designers, medical researchers and physicians to each workshop, so that the needs of different user groups can be discussed, compared, and related.\n\nThe main output of these workshops will be a set of comic-style 'personas' and 'data sharing journeys' that capture the collectively-realized visions of who PGO users are and what their needs are (e.g. personas), as well as to situate these users in a wider ecosystem that includes not only end-users, but also clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and even PGO designers themselves (e.g. data sharing journeys.)",

Within and across nearly every domain, it is argued that new modes of aggregating and analyzing data hold the promise of addressing the major social and scientific issues of our times: from agriculture to healthcare, and from interoperability to computational reproducibility.\n\nTaking the NSF-funded Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs and Spokes as our point of departure, we situate this recent initiative in a much longer historical arc of large-scale and long-term research infrastructure development in the US dating back more than 50 years. From this perspective, BDHubs is a key site for analyzing the ongoing and mutual (re)shaping of policy, technological development, and organizational dynamics at the dawning of a new era of data science.\n\nA central objective of our project is thus to characterize these changes that are occurring at the very moment the BDHubs program is being rolled out. Here, we are attentive to the strategies that the Hubs + Spokes deploy as they adapt to -- while simultaneously participate in furthering -- the enhanced capacities of information science and technologies, as well as the formation of novel institutional arrangements among government, industry, nonprofit organizations, and academia.\n\nUnpacking large-scale, cross-sector collaborations centered on the tools and techniques of data processing and visualization motivates a fundamental insight: that the advent of data science in the US is not only indicative of a burgeoning paradigm of technical research but points to a broader institutional movement whose very unfolding warrants further exploration. Our research program establishes a coherent ethnographically-informed analytic framework for mapping technological assemblages and policy pathways, one that should find relevance to students of science, policymakers, and practitioners alike.",
