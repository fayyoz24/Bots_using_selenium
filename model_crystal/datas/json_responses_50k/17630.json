    "summary": "Motivated by a deep commitment to effecting social change and a passionate concern for human and non-human life, my mission revolves around the facilitation and amplification of initiatives focused on transformative education, global justice, and addressing the climate crisis.\n\n\ud83d\udcda My journey has been a multidisciplinary exploration, dedicated to unraveling the intricate nuances of human behavior and societal dynamics. It was during this journey that I developed a strong affinity for qualitative research. \n\n\ud83c\udf31 Collaborating with local Extinction Rebellion climate activists to assess the impact of micropolitical practices on transformative social change proved pivotal in my learning curve. My goal is to harness these research-driven tools to kindle curiosity, foster inclusive dialogue, and catalyze meaningful social action.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 In my role as an Account Manager at the multi-cultural media agency IamExpat, I oversee a broad spectrum of over 100 campaigns spanning the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. Within this capacity, I draw on my expertise to proactively handle a range of communication management duties, including strategic messaging, webinar production, analytic report development, and workshop facilitation.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 My hobbyist forays into digital content creation - during which I learned video filming and editing, illustration, editorial content creation, and web and portfolio building - awakened my spirit and readiness to deliver impactful resources through various channels.\n\n\ud83c\udf7f In my free time, I find joy in experimenting with new recipes, indulging in contemporary fiction, immersing myself in (usually mind-bending) movies, practicing yoga, and engaging in friendly competition at the CrossFit gym.\n\nThink I could be a useful addition to your project?
