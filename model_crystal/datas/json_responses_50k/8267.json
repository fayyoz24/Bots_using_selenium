I furthermore supported Forth Global's Risk Advisory activities and liaised with the consultants and clients. To round up this experience, I participated in an NGO Safety and Security training, which gave me a thorough understanding of operational challenges in crisis regions and taught me about the importance of human behaviour as a de-escalation tool. Considering that the internship was conducted remotely, I strengthened my communication as well as my critical thinking skills and worked pro-actively and independent.",
