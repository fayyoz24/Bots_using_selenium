    "summary": "Hi, I am Roos!\n\nI want the world to be a more equal place where everyone has access to good quality healthcare!\nAs an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering for Global Health at Delft University of Technology I research how medical technology can play a role in increasing access to healthcare around the world. \n\nWe research for example current biomedical engineering practices and work on the development of innovations to increase sustainable access to medical technology. Additionally, we focus on training of both biomedical engineers and clinicians that work in the often challenging settings in many low-resource areas around the world.\n\nWe are always looking for collaborations with engineers and surgeons, so please reach out if you are interested. \nr.m.oosting@tudelft.nl",

This project is part of the Delft Global Initiative (https://www.tudelft.nl/global/). \n\nThe focus on global surgery within Biomedical Engineering is very new, I therefore had to set-up a new network of hospitals, universities, companies and NGOs in order to conduct context research. To do so, I worked and lived in Nairobi for a period of 5 months and I additionally visited various other countries in Africa. I conducted projects together with researchers from Kenyatta University in Nairobi,Kenya, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya and John Hopkins University, amongst many others. \n\nI worked on the development of a context-specific electrosurgical devices in a multi disciplinary team to enhance access to minimally invasive surgery on a global scale. Additionally, I published 5 papers in various international journals, presented my work on conferences in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Europa and the USA and organised a symposium on global surgery in Delft.  \n\nAdditionally, I researched current treatment methods of cervical cancer in collaboration with the Dutch NGO the Female Cancer foundation (FCF). \n\nA Pdf version of the dissertation that I defended on December 12th, 2019,  can be found via the following link: https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:330eec0a-7a67-4184-8716-9a6b456ddae9",
