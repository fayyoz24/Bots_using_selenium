    "summary": "As a recent graduate of International Business from Avans University of Applied Sciences, I have a passion for creative, innovative, and sustainable solutions that can benefit both the planet and the people. I have gained valuable communication, management, and research skills from my education and internships.\n\nIn my most recent role as an Online Marketing Intern at Etrias, an e-commerce platform, I helped increase the online visibility and sales of various products, using SEO, Google Analytics, and social media strategies. I also collaborated with the product development team to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve the customer experience and satisfaction.\n\nPreviously, I worked as a Research Intern at AgroFair, a fair trade organization that supports small-scale farmers in developing countries. AgroFair is a Dutch company importing fair trade tropical fruits, such as bananas or coconuts, into the European market. I conducted market research and analysis on the potential of organic and biodynamic bananas in Europe.\n\nOne of my proudest achievements was co-founding PimpMyPlanet.com, a project that aimed to find an alternative to single-use plastic cutlery. With the help of an inspiring team, I developed prototypes of edible and compostable cutlery made of bioplastic from local potatoes destined to end in waste. This project showcased my creativity, entrepreneurial spirit, and environmental awareness.\n\nI am eager to learn from and connect with other professionals who share my vision and values.

This process involves making strategic decisions which impact the organisation and stakeholders outside the organization. During this semester course, I gained an understanding of the strategic decision making process which organizations make and the forces influencing these decisions. I acquired the necessary knowledge to realise that decisions\nmade at a corporate level will only be successful if they are translated into actions at divisional and operational levels within the organization.\nThe Stategic Business Decisions project is different than the other study years. It is interdisciplinary, integrated and aligned. Case studies play a pivotal role in SBD and allow students to simulate making strategic decisions and evaluate effect. Next to a profit-orientation, special attention is given to\npeople and planet throughout this semester. The intention of this semester course (20\nweeks) is to consolidate and build on the knowledge I have acquired throughout the\npast three years.\n\nThroughout this project, I was able to understand: \n- The interdependence of the different disciplines within an organization.\n- The importance of taking a balanced approach to strategic decisions.\n- The interdependence between the different levels within organizations and the possible synergies that can be obtained from a suitable management of organizational change.\n\nAdditionally, I was able to assess the financial effects of organizational change while finding the balance between profit, people and planet.",
