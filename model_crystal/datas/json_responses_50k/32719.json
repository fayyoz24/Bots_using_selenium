    "summary": "Electric vehicles - EV charging - Power electronics - PV systems - Energy Storage - Demand Side Management - Wireless power transfer\n\nI\u2019m a Tenured Assistant professor in the DC systems, Energy conversion and Storage group in the Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy at the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. I am currently involved in several European research projects on electric vehicles, smart charging of EVs, power electronics and demand side management. I am the coordinator and a lecturer for Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Electric cars on edX.org with ~200,000 learners from 175 countries. \n\nDuring my PhD, I developed a solar powered V2G electric vehicle charger that is compatible with CHAdeMO and CCS/COMBO DC charging standard designed smart charging algorithms. The project was in collaboration with PRE Power Developers, ABB and UT Austin and showcased in the TU Delft research exhibition \u2018dig-it\u2019 2017 and was awarded the \u2018Most significant innovation in electric vehicles\u2019 at the IDTechEx Show 2018 in Berlin. You can follow my academic work via Google scholar. \n\nI\u2019m am passionate about electric vehicles and collaborate on projects related to DC micro-grids, energy management systems for smart grids, PV systems, battery storage and contactless power transfer. I have an MSc from the Delft University of Technology and B.Tech from National Institute of Technology Trichy in Electrical Engineering. I have worked for GE Global Research, Munich during my masters on power electronic based voltage controllers for distribution networks. I have collaborated with several industrial and public institutions namely DNV GL, Alfen, SolarNRG, AIT, driivz, Alliander, E-laad, Stedin, PRE and ABB. \n\nI\u2019m constantly looking for collaborators and interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting folks working on electric mobility, PV and power electronics.
