All the effort of working on hardcopy is dismissed, all the reports and recruit tag book are generated digitally and more rapidly, zero mistakes.\nIn January, I was drafted to the Command Post of 5th Main Jet Base in Merzifon, Amasya.\nI served my unit as an Administrative Office Sergeant directly reporting to Squadron Leader Erman G\u00fclm\u00fc\u015f.\nI designed new systems to handle daily, weekly soldier document needs using Microsoft Access 2007.\nManaged other sergeants to keep the track of unit routine.\nOrganized daily assignments of tasks.\nApart from all these, by the command of Base Commander Pilot Koray Uz, I lectured about basics of computer usage, to the soldiers that never interacted with a computer in their lives for two weeks and assessed their learning capabilities, motivations and challenges, with reports to the Base Commander. State approved certifications were handed to the successful participants, that met the acceptance criterias and passed the final quiz.\nI took part in many tasks and reported everything to the unit commander till I received my official certificate on the 16th of June.
