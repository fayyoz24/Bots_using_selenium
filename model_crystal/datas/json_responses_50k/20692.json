    "summary": "My name is Silvio Cacace and I am an experienced and passionate context driven test professional. I have extended experience in software testing (since 1994) within both traditional and Agile development processes. I have the ability to quickly adapt myself to new and complex projects / environments.\n\nI have knowledge of several test methods (APT, TMap, RST, etc), (test)-tools and test design techniques and have extensive experience in creating, designing, implementing and professionalising the testing process within various industries and within CI/CD pipelines. It is a challenge for me to make my colleagues stronger and transfer my knowledge and experience through training, workshops and personal coaching.\n\nMy communication skills are strong and I'm a hard worker, have a pro-active attitude with a great responsibility. I am stress resistant and a honest person who is always looking for innovations in the testing field. \n\nI am also the founder of the Agile testing method APT\u00ae & DTM, the Model Based Testing tool DTM and TestCompass\u00ae, the easy to use and early Model Based Testing tool (eMBT) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD)-supported Collaborative modeling tool, in the cloud.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/testcompass (www.compass-testservices.com)",

An easy to use interface for drawing functional flows, with auto test function if the flow can be tested. DTMtool generates in seconds test scripts, and will save time. DTMtool fits excellent within Agile Scrum based projects, and offers a solution to handle changes during projects without investing additional time in generating test scripts\n\nThe core of DTMtool is that within Agile processes, like scrum, we can start testing at the beginning of the process and that we are able to execute the testing process in a profound and structured manner during the whole process (static and dynamic tests). The goal of this is to strengthen the business case in an early stage and to be able to identify possible contradictions, unclarities and flaws in the requirements. In this way  possible recovery costs will be low (Barry Boehm). \n\nThe DTM tool ensures we can automatically generate all test scenarios over and over again (with advancing insight), even with a minimal set of requirements. This means a considerable reduction in manual labour to adapt and update the test scenarios. Besides this it is also possible to generate test scenarios based on executed risk analysis.",
