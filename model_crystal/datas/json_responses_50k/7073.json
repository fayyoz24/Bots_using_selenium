Due to very effective promotion and branding we realized a relative growth of over 30% more participants than previous years. \n\nThese events are organized for students who are in their final period of their study and starting their career. Prior to each event an intensive promotion period was established. Closing the year with our main event, the Make a Move Careerweek, with over 550 participants and 30 international companies. Based on the satisfaction study completed by 540 participants and 30 companies we received an overall grading of 8.9 out of 10. \n\n- We developed a complete new concept for a new niche event: Women at the Top, exclusively women only, hosting 120 participants in cooperation with Microsoft and Women INC, to discuss the position of women in the working environment."
