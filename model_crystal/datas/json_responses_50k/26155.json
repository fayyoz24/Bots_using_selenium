Daarvoor kent zij eenmaal per jaar de Ben Bronsema EWF-prijs toe aan de persoon of het team dat naar oordeel van de jury de meest innovatieve bijdrage levert. Dit kan een compleet concept voor een gebouw zijn, maar ook een verdere uitwerking van \u00e9\u00e9n of meer van de onderdelen die de natuur als drijvende kracht gebruiken.",

The main concept of our design was implementing climate flexibility in the building to improve comfort and reduce energy use, whilst making use of the existing potentials.\n\nWe won an honourable 2nd price with our design.",
