How to improve nitrogen efficiency: Success stories, key success factors and (cost) effectiveness.\n\nMany countries in the world, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK, the US and China, are already taking actions to solve our nitrogen inheritance problems on the environment. The key goal of this study is to list examples of success stories of reactive nitrogen abatement measures in these countries and their related environmental effects and costs effectiveness. This assessment is done on the most important nitrogen drivers, namely agriculture, industry, energy, transport and waste. In this way, a costs-benefits analysis can be done for each action. Hence, a trade-off can be made in which abatement measures are the best way to reduce reactive nitrogen.\n\nMoreover, the measures are assessed on the effectiveness for reducing the nitrogen cascade. It is much more effective to abate the formation of reactive nitrogen than to support the transformation of harmless N2 at the end of the cascade.\n\nEvaluation of the overall attitude of the student:\nJan Willem Erisman: ''It was a pleasure to work with Maxime. He is hardworking, critical and concise. He was open to suggestions and after initial start-up help found his way in an excellent manner.''\n\nThe thesis was graded with a 9 out of 10.",
