    "summary": "I enjoy being emotionally engaged in my work through co-creation and challenged on a day-to-day basis. The various activities present on my resume already convey my aspiration for creative, social and open-minded experiences and shape the person I am today. \n\nDuring my studies in International Business and Languages in Amsterdam, I spent 6 months working as a Digital Marketing Intern for the umbrella brand Ventura TRAVEL, located in Berlin. I also worked 9 months for Panda International as a Marketing intern. I wrote my bachelor thesis (grade: 7.5) for them to gain customers behaviours insights in order to create a marketing strategy.  The goal was to increase the number of sign-ups on the new website. Both internships and my thesis have taught me a lot. Refer to my work experience for a detailed explanation.  \n\nDuring that same study, I  participated in an exchange at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile where I followed all my courses in Spanish. I explored my creativity by following the Advertising program, learning about Adobe and gaining photography skills. \n\nAfter receiving my diploma in International Business, I discovered a passion for fashion design and most particularly for slow fashion solutions. I am now studying a bachelor in Fashion Textile and Design from the university of West London in their campus in Amsterdam. In parallel, I am maker for the sustainable brand Atelier F\u00e9lie and a blogger for the conscious rental clothes brand Palenta.co",

It also helps you to follow a healthy lifestyle by sharing healthy recipes tips on Facebook and its blog. Besides this, the profit was donated to the Nederlandse Hartstichting, a foundation that supports people with heart diseases by investing in scientific research and by providing care for patients.  \n\nResults: I gained practice and knowledge of marketing tools to add value to our product, for example, we created a giveaway to win a dinner for two at our partner restaurant. The goal was to create content and engagement on our social media pages by asking people to post a picture of a freshly prepared lunchbox. We then selected the best/most tasty looking box.  \nI also enhanced my skills of working in a multicultural student team.\n\nYou can watch the commercial in the media attached below.",
