            "description": "Since finishing my studies in Cameroon at the age of 18, I've had a desire to contribute towards providing  the community where I grew up with more economical stability in life. Though Helsinki is far from Cameroon, I realised I could do something in Finland, with other like minded souls, for the African community in Finland and potentially those further as well. \n\nAs chairman, the vision for the organisation was to hone the mission towards applying a greater focus around the economical empowerment of the diasporan community in Finland. A topic of significant concern in the community.  \n \nThe vision and mission statements were revised, and strategies for the future aligned accordingly. All activities based around the vision. Externally this was made visible by re-branding the visual identity of the organization, re-designing the website and all graphical materials. Internally, management was improved by introducing Google's G Suite for Non-profits, allowing for more efficient use of resources by having all tools and documents accessible on-the-go.  \n \nTo continue the tradition of enabling personal growth through new opportunities, the board would change slightly each year.  In addition to the organizing of events and activities, the role covered all the yearly and legal responsibilities of a chairman. \n \nwww.thinkafrica.fi "
