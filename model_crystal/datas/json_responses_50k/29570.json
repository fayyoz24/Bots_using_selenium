    "summary": "I am a researcher in the field of materials characterization. I have more than four years of experience with FIB/SEM (dualbeam) systems, and about two years of experience with the state-of-the-art TEM in the semiconductor industry. I have extensively worked on AFM characterization of semiconductor as well as biological samples, using methods such as C-AFM, KPFM and liquid imaging.  I also have about a year of experience working with ToF-SIMS/SPM tool, from preparation and analysis of samples to data processing. \n\nI am proficient at communicating in English, both orally and written. I was awarded the best presentation award for the life sciences category at the 22nd Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry conference held in Kyoto, Japan. I have experience working with scientific software, such as Origin and MATLAB.\n\nI am open to interesting opportunities in materials characterization research and application specialist roles.\n\nMy research profile can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raghavendran_Thiruvallur_Eachambadi",

This project was co-partnered with Prof. Filip Meysman of Antwerp University and TU Delft. I took initiative with Prof. Arnaud Delcorte for collaboration in fine-tuning the Argon GCIB beam for potential protein imaging using ToF-SIMS. I was also involved in teaching activities for the courses offered for students in BSc Physics and Biology, and BSc and MSc in Biomedical Sciences. As a senior doctoral researcher, I volunteered to mentor new PhD researchers.",

I worked on developing a methodology for determining the shape of the ion beam using Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy technique (SSRM). Tools used in my work include FEI Helios 600 dual-beam (FIB/SEM) system, Atomic Force Microscopy (Tapping mode and SSRM). This work was done in close collaboration with Fraunhofer IISB, Erlangen, Germany (www.iisb.fraunhofer.de). This work is part of STEEP-ITN (www.steep-itn.eu). I had the opportunity to visit TESCAN in Brno, CZ as part of the ITN consortium to understand the damage caused by Xe FIB. Together with our partners at the University of Nottingham, we were able to model the Ga beam pathways which led to a joint publication.",

Various nanoelectronic structures were characterized using a dualbeam system. Slices at predetermined depths were obtained using a dedicated software in conjugation with the user interface software of the system by milling with FIB and subsequent imaging using SEM. These images were later aligned and 3D images were reconstructed using a dedicated software provided by Avizo. With this, features such as voids can be extracted and a 3D volume rendering can be given. The whole process was undertaken during the internship of three months.",
