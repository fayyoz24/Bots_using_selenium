My first international experience was in 2011, when I temporarily moved to Houston, TX USA. My assignment at Marinetrans Houston was to help with the implementation of an improved accounting system and corresponding procedures. \n\nI gained more international experience when I coordinated the ISO 9001:2008 certification of the offices in Houston, Oslo and Singapore, in 2013 and 2014. I started working on the ISO 14001:2004 certification (environmental management system) together with all certified offices in 2015. At the same time, Marinetrans Germany in Hamburg was included in the certification cycle. \n\nOver the years, I have had the opportunity to attend several international company exhibitions as a Marinetrans host. It is an honor to work with the different offices and with people from different backgrounds and cultures. And it is extremely interesting to experience the differences in each region, but also the similarities. It is a wonderful company with a dedicated and knowledgeable network and staff. I am excited to take part of the future of Marinetrans.\n\nMarinetrans is the world\u2019s largest fourth-party logistics service provider (4PL) specialized in forwarding and logistics of marine spare parts. The company is headquartered in Singapore and has additional offices in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Korea, Japan and Houston. Through a network of dedicated partners, among which Best Global Logistics, Marinetrans uses 22 warehouses and provides services in 2,000 ports worldwide.",

                    "description": "As the Quality & Risk Manager of BGL, my first assignment was for our offices and warehouses in Lijnden and Rotterdam to become AEO and ISO 9001:2008 certified. This was realized in June 2011, during my third year of college. Thereafter, I got the opportunity to work for Marinetrans in Houston, TX in the USA for six months. \n\nWhen I returned, I continued managing and developing the AEO and quality systems at BGL, in addition to gaining experience with human resource management. My graduation assignment, which was finalized in May 2014, was a research into the future role of a 3PL freight forwarder; how will the market and our business change in the coming 10 years? It is interesting to see how the expectations in 2014 have developed over the past years.\n\nSince graduation, I have been maintaining previous tasks, in addition to becoming ISO 14001:2015 certified (environmental), managing three relocations of our office and warehouses and I have coordinated the implementation of a new operational and administrative system. It has been a wonderful journey in a company that continuously develops. And I am looking forward to the future of the Best Global Logistics Group.\n\nBest Global Logistics is a Dutch independent third-party logistics service provider (3PL) offering complex and time-critical logistics solutions on a global scale. The company operates two bonded and free-zone warehouses located near Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. BGL has strong presence in the maritime industry, while also serving a range of other industries.",

It was a great experience learning to deal with customers and negotiate, which was quite scary at first. I cherish this time, because I had the opportunity to work with my father and to learn from him. And because we had the most beautiful store in all of Amsterdam. \n\nBy Combining traditional Eastern shapes with own ideas, the designs of Fanous Ramadan's lamps fit within today's modern interior. The lamps have a surprisingly effect on your living room, hallway, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. The Lamps are traditionally produced in a network of small businesses in Ca\u00efro, Egypt that Fanous Ramadan has built over the last twenty years. This handcraft, which is still practiced by a small number of practitioners, is threatened with extinction.",
