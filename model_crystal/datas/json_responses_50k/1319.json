The project aims to work together with female refugees still in the asylum seeker centres to already develop a network, help organise and take part in different workshops that will not only keep them occupied whilst still in the system but allow them to continue to develop and enhance their own talents. The current waiting periods for a status in the Netherlands are very long, in which time the refugees are not able to further develop. Having nothing to do all day, no purpose, is very damaging to the brain and to one's motivation and for this reason, too many refugees are not able to pick up where they left off as soon as possible after receiving a status. This project aims to avoid this 'brain waste' and to work towards maximising their productivity after receiving their status, but most importantly, enhancing their well-being both whilst still in the asylum seeker's centers and in their futures.",

I was also the representative and contact person of the residents for the housing agency, Lefier, as well as during monthly meetings at Het Groninger Bewonersoverleg Studentenhuisvesting (Grobos).  As treasurer of the flat, I was responsible for all the logistics, improvements and finances of the residents committee. I also chaired the weekly board meetings in which I, together with the 5 floor-representatives (i.e., Nestrices) discussed and worked to resolve all resident's affairs. In addition, as chair lady of the Party committee, I organised and hosted social events for the entire flat. \n\nInteresting: In the newspaper due to action against fraud;\nDuring my time as head resident, many residents were victims of Digi-D fraud (for more information see the photo of the newspaper article). When I figured out what was going on, I reported it to the police. However, they did not come into action and the problem ensued - meaning that the criminals were entering our flat daily and it could not be known how dangerous that could be for the ladies. Although it was not my responsibility, I felt I was in the best position to be able to collect the evidence needed for the police to take this seriously. In the end, after daily visits over a few weeks to the police station with more and more evidence, finally the perpetrators were arrested whilst in action.",

The project aims to work together with women refugees still in the asylum seeker centres to already develop a network, help organise and take part in different workshops that will not only keep them occupied whilst still in the system but allow them to continue to develop and enhance their own talents. The current waiting periods for a status in the Netherlands are very long, in which time the refugees are not able to further develop. Having nothing to do all day, no purpose, is very damaging to the brain and to one's motivation and for this reason, too many refugees are not able to pick up where they left off as soon as possible after receiving a status. This project aims to avoid this 'brain waste' and to work towards maximising their productivity after receiving their status, but most importantly, enhancing their well-being both whilst still in the asylum seeker's centers and in their futures.\n\nNederlands:\nEen wetenschappelijk onderbouwd psychologische interventie ontworpen om de \u2018brain waste\u2019 van vrouwelijke vluchtelingen te vermijden en, in plaats daarvan, een platform te bieden voor verdere ontwikkeling van talent en de verbetering van hun toekomst en welzijn."
