    "summary": "\"I am a citizen, not of Athens or Greece, but of the world\" - Socrates. \nAn ethnic Indian with a German Nationality, product of an international school curriculum, residency in Switzerland, and student life in the Netherlands, this quote best describes my life.\n\nI am driven by my desire to make a future in the field of Marketing. \nI am adept in building relationships, consensus and a shared sense of purpose and I have a growing interest in work and organisational psychology. I study Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam where I have expanded my knowledge on Economics, Strategy and Organisation, Digital Firms, Financial Accounting, Statistics and Business Research Methods and discovered various interests in Marketing, Finance, HR, and Organisational Behaviour. \n\nI am an individual who is always open to getting to know new people, from different backgrounds, in order to further develop my understanding of the world around me. My years in the Junior and Senior football varsity team and in the varsity tennis team have enabled me to maximise my collaborative and leadership skills. I am a strong communicator and have demonstrated excellent leadership skills throughout my school life. If you catch me outside of schoolwork, I'm an adventurous traveler - 20 countries and counting! I am passionate about extreme sports and music. \n\nThe survival of the human race depends on constantly evolving and adapting and as an individual, I follow this theory of consistent evolution through developing new interests and reshaping my evaluation of life. \n\n Reach out if you would like to connect.",
