    "summary": "Hello, I am an Industrial designer having expertise in sketching, concept ideation, 3-D modeling and quick prototyping. Having worked mostly on projects involving consumer electronics, healthcare and electrical appliances, I have an inclination towards those product segments. Initial internships in a Healthcare IT firm and numerous industrial design consultancies managing and executing User Interface projects give me additional experience in those sectors to the extent that I am confident in communicating across disciplines in a multi-disciplinary setting.\n\nMy goal as an industrial designer has changed over the years as I worked and learned. I believe my exposure to good design and meeting new people, knowing their journeys has made me re-assess my goals and approach constantly. While I started off wanting to create beautiful products that provide some sort of added value to a user's life, I now wish to create impact through my design approach which includes a combination of unique aesthetics, novel innovation aspect and a social meaning behind every project.",

I was also responsible for working on a User Interface project, an extension to one of the industrial design projects where I made the visual design, screen iterations and visual experience for the interface.

As an intern, I was responsible for the shell design of the drones with a strict constraint on weight. I was also responsible for researching possible manufacturing methods and prototyping the shells to test their feasibility. This aspect of the project was achieved using a 3D printer. I learned quite a lot in just 2 months from creating a project plan to designing under strict constraints to prototyping and testing with available means in the lockdown. The end result was satisfactory to me and a personal achievement. The project can be viewed on my website(available in the contact info).",

It was there that I also had the opportunity to work on the Samsung project: Tunestation that later went on to win an iF Design Award. I attribute my current understanding of aesthetics and 3D modelling knowledge to my time there and it has been an essential starting step for my career.",
