    "summary": "Having worked and lived extensively in various contexts in the Global South, Steyn began to develop a keen interest for documentary photography as a means to provoke a wider and more nuanced discussion around (mis)representation and foster dialogue and action around social and environmental injustices. Always rooted in social sciences research traditions, this is something he would refer to as visual- and research based activism, especially in conjunction with other media. \n\nHe founded iMPACT JOURNEY as a platform and project agency, to support visual storytellers around the world. in 2017 he co-founded a non-profit space for documentary photography with his sister, iMPACT DOC. They hosted various masterclasses, documentary screenings and co-curated exhibitions in Amsterdam and in international partnerships. Core to most of their activities was the bringing together of academics, journalists and visual artists. Not only to learn, but also to co-create.\n\nHis work was recognised by several international media and institutions through awards, grants and publications.  He is always on the look-out for new and unexpected collaborations between disciplines and cross-overs between media. None of the 'visual projects' were commissioned, but rather self initiated and researched. \n\nSteyn was born in the Netherlands (1986), where he studied Cultural Anthropology, Development Sociology (BSc) at the Radboud University Nijmegen and Environmental Science (MSc) at the VU University Amsterdam. Currently he is working as a PhD researcher in Human Geography at Loughborough University in the UK, exploring just energy transitions in urban informal settlements. Ethnography, Participatory research and co-production of visual stories are at the core of his research and dissemination. He currently lives in Accra.",

However, a recent report (ESMAP, 2020) shows that still 4 billion people lack access to affordable, reliable and clean energy services to meet their basic needs. Even though it varies widely within- and between countries, the situation is worse in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where more than three quarters of the people remain dependent on biomass fuels, such as firewood, charcoal, dung and agricultural residues as their primary sources of household energy.\n\nThese contexts are more and more under pressure by processes of rapid urbanisation, contributing to the establishment of informal, unplanned settlements, often times characterized by a lack of adequate, reliable and basic municipal services, such as electricity, sanitation, water and waste disposal.\n\nTo meet a decent standard of living for all, this research explores how just energy (cooking) futures might look like in these peri-urban informal settlements. It attempts to provide an insight in the transition towards these futures informed by justice in a Ghanaian context. \u2028\u2028The (participatory) process and outcome will be translated and presented in an innovative way to support a wide range of expert or non-expert actors.\n\nThis research has a strong resonance with ongoing research amongst the Low Carbon Energy for Development Network (LCEDN) as well as new interests in clean cooking through the Modern Energy Cooking Services (MECS) programme.",
