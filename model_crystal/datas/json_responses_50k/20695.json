    "summary": "\ud83c\udf1f Seeking a new professional opportunity in Higher Education in The Netherlands! \ud83c\udf93\n____\nHi, I\u2019m Gloria! Welcome to my world of empowering youth, connecting generations, and championing education for a brighter future! I'm a communication and marketing professional with 5 years of experience in international education, driven to make a difference in higher education. With a strong passion for global citizenship and cultural exchange, I strive to create impactful experiences for Gen Z and the next generation, bridging cultures and shaping a more interconnected world.\n\nMy journey began in a small Italian town, where I embarked on my first international adventure at the age of 11. This ignited a lifelong passion for cultural exchange and education. Since then, I've made a meaningful impact, reaching hundreds of thousands of students globally through social media and live events.\n\nI pursued a Bachelor's degree in Corporate Communication and Public Relations at IULM University in Milan, where I immersed myself in the Erasmus+ program. As a proud member of the #ErasmusGeneration, I became deeply involved with the Erasmus Student Network (ESN), where I have served on different national and international boards. \n\nContinuously seeking new challenges, at 18 I started my career journey with YouAbroad as Communication and Social Media Coordinator, where I honed my expertise in marketing and communication strategy, working side by side with the CEO, Managing Director and Marketing Manager. \n\nI currently live in The Netherlands after an incredible gap year and I am a Marketing and Communication Strategy Consultant at YouAbroad. On the side, I am the Main Chair of the International Committee for Education of the Erasmus Student Network and a commissioner of the Italian Youth Council in the Education and Career Committee.\n\nMy personal purpose is to foster global citizenship and development through education. With my specialization in higher international education, marketing, and communication strategy, I strive to create meaningful connections and bridge cultures.\n\nIf you're passionate about making a difference and expanding your global network, let's connect over a (virtual) coffee!
