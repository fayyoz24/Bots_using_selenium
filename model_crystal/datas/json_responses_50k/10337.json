    "summary": "My experiences in universities, research institutes, and start-ups have reinforced in me the intellectual flexibility and nimbleness that these times of accelerating change require of innovation leaders. Undertaking projects has not only allowed me to develop specific knowledge in R&D but also a valuable and transferable skill set in managing research projects, fine-tuned communication skills, and teamwork with diverse stakeholders. Seeking out innovative R&D projects has shaped me into a highly collaborative team player working with multiple international team members. Having worked in four countries I have become committed to adapting and learning local cultures and languages, making connections with people who find me to be a flexible and independent person.",
