            "description": "Interdisciplinary teams were asked to design solutions to stimulate an economy based on tourism in the city of Campos do Jord\u00e3o by means of information and communication technology.\nThe proposed concept idea focuses on a problem of touristic information accessibility, availability, and coherence. The conducted research showed an overall inability of tourists as well as locals to allocate relevant information about city and events happening in the city. The proposed concept idea consists of Info booths with an interactive board placed on strategic places in the city. The kiosk is designed with sustainability in mind, it is powered by solar energy, it provides wifi to those in its proximity. There is personnel available to answer any kind of questions, help users who might not have high technical literacy to use the interactive board and also provide people with various printed materials such as maps and brochures. On the interactive board, users can explore various points of interest around the city such as attractions, restaurants, doctors, accommodation, transportation, shopping places, toilets and so on. They can easily allocate those places on the map, display directions or see the price range, menus, rating and other relevant information. There is also news feed showcasing all the latest updates about the city. The board also has an interactive feature of taking an image and applying one of the designed filters, that promote attractions and beauty of the city. After providing basic demographic information the image is being sent the selected email address. This data could later be used for future marketing purposes.\nIit was also proposed to create a coherent system that consists of responsive website, various printed materials and coherent city wayfinding system. The future opportunity is to create mobile info booth that could serve the city in peak season where the concentration of the tourists is high, but also as a promotional vehicle in other cities.",

With the help of social proof, we can showcase which problems are the most important for the citizens. We aim to turn complaining into good think to get valuable feedback from people, the feedback that will provoke change in urban areas.\n\nThe app allows users to upload picture of the friction they feel needs improvement in order to keep the urban area as accessible as possible. The friction post consists of picture, location geotag , description of the problem written by user who uploaded the friction and category it belongs to. These categories are problems for people with movement impairment, vision impairment and hearing impairment.",

Manifested in a week of workshops, the soul purpose is to develop your knowledge and skills in innovative processes through the use of innovative methods. \n\nDMI (The Danish Meteorological Institute)\n\u201cCity weather-makeover\u201d and use of weather data for new applications\nDMI has been using Big Data for weather forecasts since before Big Data was a wide known concept. DMI wants to spread the use of their services and data to new target groups and areas.\n\n\nCONCEPT:\nWEWA - Weather wardrobe, app that suggests your daily outfit based on weather data.\nBy creating an app for smartphones, we make it an easy and fast solution for you in the morning. When you wake up and do not know what to wear? You will then press the WeWa app and it will then tell you what clothing options suit the day, based on the weather data. So WeWa knows if it is snowing, raining, or sunny and therefore how you can dress. By uploading pictures of your own wardrobe WeWa can pull together outfits that you already have in your closet, or it can give you the overall suggestions by categories ex. Wool sweater, pants, rain jacket etc. If you don\u2019t want to do the work yourself. At the bottom of the display there will be an extra option called Missing pieces, it will suggest what garments you are missing and where you can buy them. This could be done in cooperation with bigger retailers like H&M and Magasin. By making the weather data a bit hidden and more interesting for the younger audience, since they will see the opportunity in what to wear without checking a boring weather app. WeWa is connected to the data from DMI and will always stay updated on the latest weather reports, and therefore it will guide you throughout the year.\n\nThe concept won first place.",
