I have worked amongst others on the circularity scan of KPMG, several true value projects and gave input on circular examples used in projects/proposals for Rabobank, IKEA and KPN. \n\nThe main topic of my thesis is \"Circular Business Models\", with a focus on Closed Loop Supply Chains and Product-Service-Systems. The problem that this thesis addresses, are the difficulties that companies are facing to \"close the loop\" of their supply chains. Referring to problems with product acquisition and insufficient utilisation of the value in products and materials. The research explores the conditions for which a (user-oriented & result-oriented) Product-Service System could help to close supply chain loops.  For example through the product stewardship and optimal resource efficiency by leasing or rental models. The research is executed by means of a survey and in-depth interviews. The final deliverable is a practical tool/framework that helps companies to implement a more circular business model.",
