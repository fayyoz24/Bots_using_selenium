It has also been on display during international design events in London, Paris, Milan and Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2022, I started a collaboration with Ecologisch Adviesbureau Maes (EAM). Commissioned by this agency, I work on research regarding indigenous tree populations in the Netherlands. Likewise, I process this data in GIS-software. Projects that I worked on are for municipalities, regional water authorities, organizations and private land owners. I also work on morfological research for EAM. \n\nI founded Morgan Ruben B.V. at the end of 2016. Early 2020 I started working for my own firm for at least 4 days a week.
