That I could not make the world in which we live a better place.\n\nThose sparks while burning my eyes, ignited a fire within my soul,\nA burning passion, to understand, to learn, to seek, and to build.\n\nIt inspired me to work, to grow, every single day, to improve both myself, and the world in which we live.\n\nTo Build, To Grow, To Learn, and to Teach, every moment that I am alive. \nTo take on the global responsibilities, and face new challenge's whenever possible. \n\nAs a Sustainopreneur I now have that chance, to build that Future that we all deserve, \ngrateful and honored, yet humbled and contrite, as Mentor, a Teacher, a Student, and a Friend.\n\nAnd with that mentality, that drive, that passion, I will keep building, \ntoday, tomorrow, the rest of my life, towards a better future for humanity, \nuntil my very last day on this earth.",
