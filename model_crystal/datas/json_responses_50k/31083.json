(1.3 German Grading Scheme)\n\nAbstract\nThe automotive industry is currently in the middle of digital transformation and strongly influenced by innovations and megatrends and, furthermore faces drastic changes in terms of human and technical requirements. For a long time already, innovative ability and innovation culture have been regarded as success factors for companies. With innovation communication represending an interdisciplinary form of corporate communication, innovation management processes can be accompanied and supported strategically and target group-specifically right from the beginning. Methods such as gamification provide new possibilities for the transfer of knowledge and transparent dissemination of highly complex and sensitive topics of digitalization. This work examines the field and the importance of innovation communication and gamification as success factors for the innovation management process. For this purpose, action recommendations for target group-specific communication methods for the innovation process and the knowledge transfer of basic technologies are considered in greater detail at AUDI AG.",
