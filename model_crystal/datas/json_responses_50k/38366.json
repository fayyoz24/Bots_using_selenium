    "summary": "I am always interested in looking for new possibilities, in a wide range of technical and IT industries available in The Netherlands.

I felt as if I\u2019ve remained flexible to learn and resolve issues in a wide range of potential challenges and goals, focusing on ensuring positive measurable results for any given project and myself. I have been developing my soft skills to improve my flexibility, goal orientation, management of responsibility, and work under pressure. I wish to find challenging yet rewarding positions that would fit well with my profile and provide a constructive impact on any necessary business goal. I believe that my technical background, cultural affinity, work experience, wide range of languages, managerial experience, motivation and analytical capabilities make me a strong and adaptive candidate. Please feel free to reach me for any questions or dialogue, wishing everyone a great day!",
