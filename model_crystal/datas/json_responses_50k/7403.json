Since its inception in 2006, vidaXL has evolved from importing goods exclusively from China and selling them on eBay Germany to becoming a robust organization with approximately 200 employees. Today, vidaXL operates across several European countries, Australia, and through popular platforms such as eBay and Amazon, as well as its own web shops.\n\nIn my previous role as a project manager and implementation consultant, I played a pivotal role in the initial implementation phase at vidaXL. This phase involved the successful deployment of an integrated email and call-tracking solution, supported by a comprehensive internal multilingual knowledge base that leveraged case-based reasoning. To achieve seamless operations, I led the development of crucial integrations with various systems, including CTI integration with the MassXess telephony platform, email integration with eBay Message & Feedback, and customer and order information integration with eBay, Amazon, Magento, and Heidler. Additionally, I oversaw the rollout of the Webselfservice component across the different web shops, ensuring its availability in over eight different languages.\n\nBy effectively managing this implementation, I enabled vidaXL to enhance its customer support capabilities, streamline communication channels, and optimize its overall service delivery. These efforts contributed to improved customer satisfaction, increased operational efficiency, and ultimately, accelerated business growth.",
