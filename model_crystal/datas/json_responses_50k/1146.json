Added content for more than 10 new hotels and executed SEO and content strategies for each property (per country and continent). \n\nLed and executed photoshoots and marketing campaigns for new and existing properties. \nManaged a small team of content creators and translators of the French and Dutch websites. \nManaged a corporation with Google indoor maps for 13 properties. \nLed a chat project for the CX team partially powered by Ai resulting in a massive reduction in time-consuming email communications.  \n\nWorking for citizenM gave me what no degree could.
