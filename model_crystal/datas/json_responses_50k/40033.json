These chambers were created in the medical center to help family members of patients that are undergoing treatment for cancer in the hospital. Not only the patient needs help to overcome his or her illness but also family members and people behind the patients have questions and perhaps need help. The noble cause of these chambers is to close that gap, answer questions and be there to help. These chambers are not funded by the hospital or get money form the government. The hotel and the foundation were introduced by a mutual friend to Professor Pinedo and the board of the foundation Time Out Chambers. Together we created a plan; a Mid Summer Night Gala to raise money. The first Gala took place in 2007 and raised over 150.000 euro for the chambers. "
