As a key leader in the organization, I was responsible for various essential tasks that contributed to the hospital's success.\n\nOne of my significant accomplishments was leading the recruiting efforts for new staff members, ensuring that we had a skilled and dedicated team to provide excellent veterinary care. To facilitate the onboarding process and promote consistency, I created a comprehensive training manual for all incoming staff for every department. \n\nWith a focus on delivering high-quality medical services, I controlled the daily schedule, ensuring that our patients received the best possible care. Delegating daily work assignments for up to 50 staff members, I fostered an efficient and collaborative work environment.\n\nRecognizing the importance of exceptional customer service, I wrote standardized phone scripts and managed a 20-line phone room staffed by 5 team members dedicated to answering incoming calls promptly and professionally. I diligently tracked phone room staff.",
