    "summary": "My career started in the field of Education. Between 1989 and 1999 I worked as a teacher, curriculum developer, and manger of European exchange and bilingual education programmes in California, Spain, the Netherlands and Oman.  In 1999 I began to study whales and dolphins along the coast of Oman, culminating in a PhD focusing on Arabian Sea humpback whales in 2004.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012 I conducted coastal dolphin research in Malaysia, training three local MSc students at the Universiti of Malaysia Sarawak.   This was followed  by a three-year term as the Marine Coordinator at WWF Gabon.\n\nIn 2015 I moved to the Netherlands and became a consultant. Megaptera Marine Conservation is registered with the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands, and allows me to take on consultancy contracts anywhere in the world.  Contracted projects to date include the coordination of the Arabian Sea Whale Network as well as the Consortium for the Conservation of Atlantic Humpback Dolphins (ongoing); development and maintenance of the content in the International Whaling Commission's Online Whale Watching Handbook (https://wwhandbook.iwc.int/en/); a 6-month long maternity cover position as the Coordinator for the International Whaling Commission's Bycatch Mitigation Initiative (2018-19), coordination of WWF's global Marine Cetacean Initiative (2017-2020),  and support to the Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMA Secretariat) (ongoing).  Alongside paid consulting work, I continue to support cetacean research and conservation projects in Oman, Malaysia and Gabon on a volunteer basis, and serve as Deputy Chair of the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group and a member of the IUCN SSC Marine Conservation Committee.  I am also a regular invited participant to the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission.",
