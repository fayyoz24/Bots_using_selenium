    "summary": "I hold a Ph.D. in Community Health (Health Service Management) from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia, in 2020. I received numerous awards for my academic excellence and extracurricular activities during my studies. I earned a  master\u2019s degree in nursing (Education) from the Faculty of Nursing, Lincoln University College, Malaysia, in 2015, where I was honored to have received the Dean's Award for my academic achievements, and my CGPA was 3.83 out of 4.00. My educational background includes a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing, which I obtained in 2009 at the Faculty of Nursing at Tishreen University in Syria. \nBefore joining Lincoln University College, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at Taiz University's Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Nursing Department, in Yemen. I was also a Staff Nurse at the Yemen International Hospital, where I administered total nursing care and supervised patient care to maintain high standards of comfort and care. This dual role enabled me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, strengthening my clinical skills and fostering a deep understanding of the challenges faced by healthcare providers. During my Ph.D. studies, I worked part-time as a lecturer at Lincoln University College's Faculty of Nursing. After completing my Ph.D., I started working as a full-time lecturer at the Faculty of Nursing and Faculty of Applied Sciences at Lincoln University College in Malaysia. Additionally, I served as an Executive Officer in the Student Affairs Division at Universiti Putra Malaysia.\n\nWith my strong academic background and expertise in community health, nursing, nursing education, healthcare management, and scientific research, I am excited for the opportunity to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic organization that shares my passion for improving healthcare and advancing scientific research. This could be in hospitals, universities, schools, or research institutes.\n\nI am a motivated team player who actively participates in teamwork, volunteering, and academic research, finding joy in achieving goals.",
