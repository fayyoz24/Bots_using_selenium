The state-of-the-art framework of variational asymptotic method (VAM) was extended for thick beams and analytical expressions were derived for 2-D cross sectional analysis. Further an asymptotically exact 1-D beam was analysed using nonlinear finite element analysis and used to recover the 3-D solutions. The results were compared with full 3-D solutions obtained using ABAQUS and shown to be numerically accurate and computationally inexpensive.\n",

In a nutshell the project aims to study about the reduction of vibrations experienced by the top storey in a building by increasing the thickness of the roof of the ground floor. This thick roof helps in blocking the vibrations. The project was analysed mathematically using Newmark Beta Algorithm . Practical study was also conducted using a shake table .",

The general aim of this project is to develop extended multiscale computational homogenization frameworks that can lift the existing limits in terms of scale separation. Several classes of engineering problems exist in which scales strongly interact, naturally violating scale separation limits and hence compromising the applicability of conventional multiscale analysis techniques.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, the mathematical theory of asymptotic homogenization was adopted to analyze linear, two-phase composite materials. Higher-order asymptotic homogenization was shown to be capable of predicting the homogenized response accurately even for extremely low scale separations. Size effect was studied and validated with full-scale numerical simulations, where Finite Difference Method was made use of. \n\nThe framework was later extended to nonlinear mechanical metamaterials, which undergoes local elastic buckling under compression. These instabilities give rise to a peculiar pattern transformation, with complex boundary layers based on the boundary conditions. An enriched computational homogenization framework was developed taking on board long-range spatially correlated fluctuations, in addition to fast-scale microfluctuations, resulting in a micromorphic continuum at the macroscale.\n\nIn the final phase of this project, the developed homogenization framework is extended to study elastomeric honeycomb structures which exhibit multiple pattern transformations. The method is shown to be numerically highly accurate and computationally extremely cheap. Finite Element Method is adopted.\n\nProgramming Language adopted: MATLAB",
