    "summary": "I am a finance professional focused on business valuation with more than 6 years of experience with valuation projects in KPMG and PwC. \n\nI acquired extensive insight into financial analysis, accounting, financial planning and financial modelling while working for clients in diverse industries such as industrial production, services, energy, real estate, utilities and others.  \n\nI focused on business and real estate valuation as well as valuation of intangible assets and delivered services to clients located in Europe with a focus on the Czech Republic and Central Europe. Our valuation team supported the strategic decisions of clients and advised them during transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, litigations, and internal restructuring. \n\nAdditionally, I utilized my valuation and finance expertise in projects that extended beyond my line of service and complemented the work of e.g. audit, tax, and other advisory teams. \n\nI studied Finance at The Faculty of Finance and Accounting at Prague University of Economics and Business and Corporate Finance at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. I passed all three levels of the CFA Program and I am a CFA charterholder.",
