My education was a wonderful opportunity to work in the field I am absolutely passionate about and experienced the synthesis of art, technology, sociology, methodology, theory, and history. \nSince I have lived in four countries (Iran, Italy, Spain & The Netherlands) I was able to open my view for design in different geographical and cultural contexts; from the Middle East to Europe and from renovation to contemporary designs. \nIn my current position as a data collector, I have a chance to be a small part of an amazing team & travel to many cities to collect data for ParkMe app. I'm looking forward to having more professional experiences in different countries.",
