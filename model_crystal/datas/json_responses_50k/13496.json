To provide urgent care, the umbilical cord is therefore cut before the baby is breathing and the baby taken away from the mother to the resuscitation table. Cutting the umbilical cord however, causes a \u201cshock\u201d in blood oxygen flow and increases the risk of injury to vital organs, especially the brain and intestine. These injuries can persist in the long term, resulting in disabilitating health outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of Concord Neonatal is to help babies win in the first minutes of life. The realization of the Concord Birth Trolley allows cord clamping to take place at a time when the baby is fully stable. It allows the baby to get the maximum benefit from the blood of the placenta up to the moment it is breathing on its own. It also allows the baby to receive the best resuscitation intervention while remaining with the mother. With its innovative design, the concord trolley improves survival, reduces complications, prevents long-term disability, reduce the costs of care, and sustains the healthy mother-child contact at birth.",
