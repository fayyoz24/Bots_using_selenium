Test subject is Thermoplastic Composite Pipes (TCPs). \n\nStrohm has the world\u2019s largest track record for TCPs, having brought the technology to market in 2007. We are committed to driving sustainability with our range of composite sub-sea flow-lines and jumpers which helps clients to reach their net-zero carbon emissions targets. We provide our full support to partners and clients in the green hydrogen industry, on CCUS projects, and on some cutting-edge concepts like blue and green ammonia offshore. \nTCP is a strong, non-corrosive, spool-able, lightweight pipeline solution which can be delivered in long lengths, resulting in a significant reduction of transportation and installation costs. It has proven to reduce the Carbon di-oxide footprint of pipeline infrastructures by more than 60%. Therefore, it is the most reliable and cost effective solution to transport hydrogen offshore. \nStrohm is headquartered in IJmuiden in the Netherlands where its manufacturing plant is also located. It has additional offices in Houston (US), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Our shareholders include Chevron Technology Ventures, Evonik Venture Capital, Shell Ventures and HydrogenOne.\n\nInterested in our Thermoplastic Composite Pipes?\nPlease feel free to contact us:\n \u2709 info@strohm.eu\n \u260e +31(0)255 763 500",
