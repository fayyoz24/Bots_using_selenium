    "summary": "I work with logistics/freight companies looking to gain efficiency in operations to improve bottomline.\nTogether with a global team we enable our growth strategy. I love collaborating with businesses globally who are interested in improving their business. Identify areas of improvement where technology can bring value (being happier customers|employees, higher revenue|profitability, reduce costs|risks).\n\nComplex processes and business operations, modelled, planned, simulated and optimised to transform an issue into a competitive advantage. Solution applications that transform businesses, solving complex puzzles that help people make the best decisions at the right time.\n\n15 years combined experience in supply chain, logistics, IT, advanced analytics and optimisation, people management, transformation projects, B2B enterprise SW sales and strategy.\n\nBeliever in teams that make a difference; of analysis and processes -to replicate success, and of people's motivation -that spark excitement and engagement on what we do (leadership).\n\nI love complex puzzles and this is why I have fun working Dassault Systemes, being at the forefront of technology and transformation that make an impact in the largest businesses, their customers and the environment.\n\nAbout me: I was raised in tugboats & ships. Later I grew up in race-car shops building and preparing stock cars, formulas, rallies. Every day at the shop and every weekend at the racetrack. Competitiveness is in the blood, and it is also a gentlemen's sport, where preparation makes a difference. Loved races from the pits, not the stands. Then I was also involved with large machinery for construction, selling them, repairing them, driving them. \nIn Uni I loved Math and computing subjects and I consider myself very lucky that I get to keep doing the same; but one of the best lessons was actually one day playing drums in a crowded auditorium: while giving your best, always remember to smile and try to have fun.",

Faced with the challenged of a newly signed multi-vendor services contract with a major retailer (+4,000 stores across Mexico) developed a network redesign based on operations research (linear programming) to come up with a new network of stock locations that could deliver parts under two hours >90% of the time (we were only achieving 60%). This implied growing from 6 to 32 locations. Mandatory to maintain costs flat, so rewrote the existing DHL contract we had. Key: change from flat to variable rates. Excess costs we incurred on hand carries, were now used for smaller, more dynamic stock locations. Complying with IBM security standards we opened the new stock locations by waves, and after six months achieved expected results by the model (90% ontime delivery). Costs remained flat.",
