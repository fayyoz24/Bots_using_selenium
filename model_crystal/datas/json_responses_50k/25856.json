The development was active from 2010 until 2015 and was stopped mainly because we didn't admire the code we've written while learning to program and also wanted to move to other projects.\n\nIt served as a wallpaper changer from images stored on the hard drive, but what made it popular to the Linux community, was some unique features, like the Live Earth Wallpaper and Wikipedia's Picture Of The Day. In order for those features to work, we had a Raspberry Pi powered on all the time and running scripts which were downloading, processing (merging live weather images, downsizing, etc...) and uploading the corresponding images 24/7.\n\nWith the help of an OMG! Ubuntu! article, Wallch has been translated to more than 7 languages!\n\nReviews:\nArticle in greek magazine \"Linux Inside\": www.linuxinsider.gr/magazine/linux-inside-6-parallilos-programmatismos\nOMG!
