    "summary": "Alan studied Physics before joining the British Antarctic Survey, wintering in Antarctica in 1979-81. He worked in oil exploration until joining the RAF as an Engineering Officer in 1983. Early work included operations with Chinook and Sea King helicopters, managing base support for Tornados and Chinook type engineer.\nIn 1993 he became Senior Engineer on a Tornado squadron. After Advanced Staff Training and 3 years as Tornado type engineer he went to RAF Coningsby to lead Engineering and Supply Wing.  After a year at Cambridge University he spent 5 months in Saudi Arabia supporting operations prior to Gulf War 2. He then moved to a team working with McKinsey that transformed logistics support across the MOD. Promoted to Group Captain, he helped to deliver that change through partnered support for Tornado with BAE Systems. From 2006 he led a team designing and delivering IT systems to deployed operations. \nHe joined Shell in 2008 with responsibilities for Standards and Advice, accident investigation and working to promote safety within both the manufacturing and operational arenas. In this he has travelled globally to audit and advise aviation operators working for Shell. This requires constant effort in influencing internal and external leaders and communication of the aviation safety message. Recent work has involved coordinating work to meet new requirements following a number of accidents in the North Sea.  He also monitors scheduled airline safety. He provides advice to the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service and sits on a number of committees promoting safety in the Oil & Gas sector\n\nAs well as a BSc, Alan has an MSc, Corporate Management from Cranfield and an MPhil, International Relations from Cambridge. He is a Chartered Engineer and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Married, he has two children: a daughter studying for a PhD in biomedical science at Cambridge and a son who is a surgeon.  He enjoys skiing, sailing, walking, keeping fit and travel.\n",
