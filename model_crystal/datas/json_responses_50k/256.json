    "summary": "Looking for someone who loves to tackle big challenges? I am eager to apply both my strong analytical and soft skills to think outside the box and come up with effective solutions to challenging problems. With a strong growth mindset, I aim to contribute to a company\u2019s common goals and participate in meaningful work for society.  \n\nIdeally, I am looking to apply my skills in an international environment focused on: analytical problem solving, mathematical model building, simulations and software engineering, while utilising soft skills as well. \n\nI am ready to focus on a new challenge, following up on the goals I have already achieved in my life.  For example, as a teenager I devoted my time to pole vaulting, where I continuously challenged myself to jump higher. By training full-time and competing on an international level I managed to jump, among others, to nine Dutch titles and two Dutch all-time records. Subsequently I dived deep into university life, where I constantly searched for extracurricular challenges to develop myself in various areas while strengthening a broad range of skills. I managed to excel by completing one Bachelor and two Masters Cum Laude, three fruitful internships (at Harvard University, in Rio de Janeiro and at an analytical consulting company), a successful board year, an elected position in the university council and many more interesting projects. Thereafter I challenged myself to follow my sense of adventure and curiosity and live in a Volkswagen Kombi on the road in South America, while learning valuable life lessons and focusing on personal growth. \n\nIn conclusion, my characteristics include analytical thinking, perseverance, diversity, independence, pro-activity, commitment, adaptability, honesty and I love to contribute to a healthy and pleasant work environment. I have experience with Python, C++, shell scripting, Matlab, Mathematica, R, AIMMS, HTML, CSS and I am not afraid to work with new languages. Furthermore, I am flexible location-wise and also available for remote work. \n",

There I visited fascinating places, met countless wonderful people and experienced many special and unique situations, which were all rewards stemming from my independence and creativity along with taking initiative and being communicative.  \n\nSeveral complex mechanical issues, political unrest in Chile and the Corona lock-down in Argentina has taught me to deal with serious setbacks and to find creative solutions in unknown situations. Nevertheless, persistence and commitment didn\u2019t abate and made this extended and adventurous journey possible. \n\nWhile in South America, I improved my Portuguese and learned Spanish (both with disciplined self-study and practice with local people); challenged myself physically by e.g. climbing to 6000m+, surviving several days in the jungle with only a machete, learning to kite surf and hiking for 7+ days; joined two times the NomadCruise, a 2-week digital nomad conference at sea, where I learned valuable work and life lessons of which many I could readily apply; took the time to read and think about self-development; and I made sure I satisfied my analytical mind by learning new programming languages and implementing e.g. a complex finance tracker.",

In addition, we developed a new model to describe collective cell migration to explain recent experimental observations, which is published in Nature Communications (see publication below). Part of my research I executed at the Harvard School of Public Health in the United States (see below).\n\nThe major part of my research consisted of mathematical modelling and simulation of epithelial cell layers, analytical derivation and adaptation of a complex theory (mode-coupling theory), and numerical application of this theory on the simulated as well as on experimental data. Furthermore, my project included extensive literature research and (re)defining research questions, interpreting results and creating follow up steps, communication of my ideas through many presentations and heavy discussions, and scientific writing for an article and a comprehensive report. \n\nFor me it was important to have a thorough understanding of the subject, models and theories and to be proactive by e.g. taking the lead regarding the project development and in meetings. To delve deeper into the subject and to discuss my research, I visited at own initiative several prominent researchers (Harvard, Boston university, Columbia university) in both the fields of condensed matter and biophysics.

For example, in my board year I was responsible for setting up a winter sports week for the first time; I was part of the organisation committee of the first camping week to visit several Belgian breweries; I set up a new fraternity with fifteen people; and I set up or joined the organisation of several special weekends and other activities that where held for the first time and has now become yearly activities. \n\nIn these committees and fraternities, I got assigned to different functions like chairman, treasurer, secretary and advisory member. This gave me the possibility to develop myself in different roles within a group as well as in team collaboration. Furthermore I gained a lot of experience in being responsible, organising and being practical. Lastly, being part of these organisational teams was very satisfying and enabled further development of my soft skills.",

Together with these companies, I created events and other opportunities for them to get in touch with potential employees as well as possibilities for students to meet potential employers and get informed about the job market. This resulted in a record amount of sponsoring income and a pleasant collaboration with many recruiters. In addition, I could develop my organisational and communication skills and gain experience in being proactive, constructive, flexible and practical. \n\nAs part of the board I also performed many tasks to keep the association running and to organize activities, in which I built up experience in e.g. responsibility, leadership and time management. Working intensively together with six people has taught me to collaborate on a high level and gave me valuable insights about my role in a group. For example, group cohesion is important for me as well as having an overview of what is happening and I often come up with out-of-the-box ideas and suggestions. The powerful lessons I have learned during this board year still benefit me today.",

Main task of the Bachelor committee was the monitoring and evaluation of the recently implemented Bachelor College (a new education system that completely revised all the bachelors of the university) and to review the Program and Exam Regulation in order to be approved in the University Council. Within this committee, we achieved some significant successes of which the whole university population benefited. Meanwhile, the main task of the Graduate School committee was to review and approve for the first time the Program and Exam Regulation of the Graduate School (a new education in which all the masters are completely revised), which started the following year. My role as chairman was to collect and evaluate the comments of the Department Councils and discuss them with the Dean, which has led to several adaptions of the regulation.\n\nI gained experience in formal and informal meetings on a high political level. For example, I learned to ask well-formulated questions to the leaders of the university and to defend the students\u2019 interests and concerns. It was important for me to constantly be up-to-date, stay pro-active and address the topics clearly. I always made sure to work structured and to be well-prepared, which has lead to constructive meetings and positive relationships with the people involved.",

At the age of fifteen I started to train with the national coach in a group with international athletes, which soon involved moving two hours from my home city and joining a full-time training program. This has led to nine Dutch youth titles, two Dutch youth all-time bests and competing on an international level in addition to having a lot of fun while jumping and challenging myself physically every day. \n\nWhile I might not have been as talented as others physically, I compensated this with training hard and disciplined. Attitude and perseverance determined my pole vault results, while I learned many mental skills and valuable psychological lessons by training daily and competing on a high level. For example, I learned how to develop a mindset for success, to set (realistic) goals and to work towards them effectively. I gained experience in dealing with successes and high expectations as well as dealing with disappointing results and subsequently turning the page. In total, these experiences have determined my character and today I still benefit from these mental skills and lessons.",
