The forum has three thematic streams: 1) Nature-based solutions for urban resilience: putting them into practice; 2) Improving governance for inclusive and effective climate action; and 3) Implementing, financing, and monitoring strategies for urban resilience. I had the opportunity to participate in the following breakout sessions: 1) Fostering collaboration for green infrastructure within and beyond municipal departments and 2) How to make your case: create your own nature-based solution business canvas. Also, I provided logistical support to the team."
