    "summary": "hello!\n\nI am a multidisciplinary producer and film maker focused on all things film, documentary production and social impact. I have created, produced and directed original multi-media content, worked in sustainability and non-profits, and worked in multiple production roles including a large budget international feature film production. \n\nWhen I\u2019m not creating films of my own, I\u2019m working to share and celebrate films through the exhibition and distribution industry. My focus is to create and share culturally impactful, visually stunning work that challenges the norms of storytelling, and celebrates perspectives and lives around the world. \n\nI am currently Amsterdam based and seeking to strengthen my diverse skill set and apply my production knowledge as a Producer, Production Assistant and Media Creative on larger scale productions, within creative agencies, start-ups and in film distribution and exhibition. \n\nI grew up in Australia and London and I have completed a Bachelor of Film and Screen Media Production from Griffith Film School in Brisbane in 2020. I am currently looking for new work opportunities in Amsterdam.",

The festival brings cinema and special guests to outback Australia and I coordinated the set up and back down of an open air theatre and 3 other venues, scheduled timetables and trained volunteers, created marketing and promotional material, ran social media communication channels during the event while ensuring all guest satisfaction and that all needs were met. Being able to share wonderful, heartbreaking, cathartic, electric stories with people who usually wouldn't get to see them is a special thing.",
