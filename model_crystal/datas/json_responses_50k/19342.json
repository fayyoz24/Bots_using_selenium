    "summary": "Professional athlete - cyclist \nRecently I have relocated from Australia to be based in the Netherlands as park of a Dutch professional cycling team Team Parkhotel Valkenburg. \nThis is following success last year to win the Australian National Road Championships, which has then provided me the opportunity to race in monumental events such as Paris-Roubaix, Tour de France Femmes and more world tour events. \nThe team will continue to work with me to be my best physically and mentally so I can progress in a successful cycling career.\n\nBulk Nutrients Pure Supplements \nHaving worked with Bulk Nutrients since 2014 I have recently stepped back to a contractor role here due to my sporting pursuits and living abroad. My roles here involved customer service, event management and Research and Development. The team have always supported my sporting endeavours and were the reason I commenced my studies. \n\nFederation University - student\nI am continuing my studies part-time online during my cycling career to prepare for a life after cycling. I am studying my Bachelor minor in biological Science and major in Health and Nutrition. \n\nMedia and commentary \nI have experienced in public speaking and commentating and looking to continue to expand on this I\u2019m the sporting world. My recent experience has been with GT Events for Tour of Tasmania mens and women\u2019s as well as guest pieces for ABC and content creation for Wahoo via WahooSYSTM app. ",
