    "summary": "I consider myself a keen human observer, a provocateur and a catalyst for change. I am deeply fascinated by the inherent philosophy that drives the actions of people, organisations and communities and few things excite me more than the investigation of human psychology to understand how our subconscious patterns can dictate our actions, decisions and relationships in the world. \n\nOver the last 20 years I have been fortunate to work with some tremendous teams across a variety of countries, cultures, companies and industries on a variety of strategic programs ranging from communication strategy and culture change initiatives to process and technology enablement projects. As a strategy, project and transition manager, I was responsible for delivering tangible technological and process implementations while fostering the necessary behavioural and organisational changes required for long-term success. Despite my success in these roles, the most gratifying part of my job has always remained my relentless interest in the development of an empowered and resilient workplace with real communication through open dialogue and constructive debate that enables you to harness your natural potential. This pursuit naturally drew me into more human related initiatives and led me to conclude that the most intriguing yet mysterious issues resided within the culture, the patterns and the hidden dynamics between the people within the organisation, for which we have yet not articulated a common language. \n\nAs a team dynamics coach, I give particular focus on relationships and group dynamics with the primary goal of building resilient, creative and high-performing teams. By examining the team's subconscious systemic psychology, understanding the individual personalities and promoting healthy dialogue using non-violent communication, I help lay a foundation of trust, safety and transparency. This foundation is essential for developing a culture of mutual support and collaboration. Complementing individual coaching with systemic exercises and tailored workshops using family and organisational constellations stimulates deep, accelerated transformations leading to a sustained positive change within the team.\n\nI believe that creating a world where we can safely embrace and accept our whole selves, with courage and compassion, is critical for personal and collective growth.I am committed to supporting anyone who contributes to this cause and look forward to continuing to observe, provoke, and catalyse change wherever I can.\n\nwww.qualia-quest.nl",
