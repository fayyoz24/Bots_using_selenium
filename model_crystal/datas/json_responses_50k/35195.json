    "summary": "Dedicated marketing professional with a hospitality heart, business brains & a passion for technology and innovation. \n\nAt this moment I am responsible for the marketing team of valantic. This year we rebranded from 30 years of ISM to valantic. This was a great challenge, as we were the first non-German speaking company that was added to the valantic corporation.

This also is expressed in my personal life where I ran two marathons (Berlin 2018, Rotterdam 2013) and have the ambition to run another one!
