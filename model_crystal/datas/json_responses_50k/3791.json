    "summary": "I have the pleasure to lead a seven figure operation with Mediahuis Marketplaces in real estate, recruitment, cars and online comparison. Our 16 brands thrive across Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Our local teams run these evergreen operations, whilst the central team builds up a corporate venture capital portfolio for our day after tomorrow.\n\nIn the past I have transformed multiple businesses by forging high performing teams, connecting the world of suits to the creative world of sneakers. I have pioneered digital renovations that prosperously produced tens of millions in bottom line increases.\n\nI love to pioneer new ways of working, discover deeper principles and then map these new territories. I have piloted a multitude of projects in sales, data, customer experience, agile teams, service design and lean processes. I enjoy guiding teams in the hundreds in these domains. \nTrue wisdom is the insight that we don't know. So I always experiment new things, make mistakes, then learn profoundly.\n\nUnder my leadership several nationally known brands facing an epic collapse, have bucked the trend and now enjoy a quantum leap in customers, as well as experiencing year over year sustainable growth. I learned from the very best, starting under the wings of private equity firm Egeria in 2010. \n\nI consider myself a pioneer of our time, celebrating life as a husband and as a father. Time to connect with my loved ones and myself is paramount and fulfilling. I wrote a children's book and co-authored The Relationship Economy, #22 of the 100 Best Customer Experience Books of All Time, and the leadership book The Human Touch relating my tops and flops. I speak at conferences across the globe. \n\nI hold a cum laude Master in Business Administration from Erasmus University Rotterdam and a Post-Master degree in Journalism from that same university. I pass on beauty in many dimensions. I was a regional, financial and political journalist, put literary magazine Lava on the map, founded publishing startup MatchBoox and started my career as a research consultant for The United Nations in Geneva.",

I have initiated a digital renovation in a declining print operation, and guided the company's transformation into a mobile first startup with 127 years of tradition.\n\nI methodically attracted and energized excellent individuals to forge coherent and productive teams. We build thick relationships and solve organizational puzzles together. This lead to sustainable human and business success.\n\nProud to have lead a management team that grew top line results, which is over 80 percent of the company's total revenue. We slashed costs year after year by turning chaotic operations into simplified and solid processes. Together we enhanced the gross margin with tens of millions of euros. I indirectly managed nearly two hundred souls in sales, data, customer experience and customer service.\n\nOnline sales numbers for De Telegraaf improved seven fold in two years time. On regional news we saw a 1,900% increase of acquired subscription value. I applied agile working methods for improved cooperation between formerly alienated departments. Setting the agenda together and truly understanding each other, ensured much faster and more coherent innovation. Using service design methods we made sure we listened to our employees and our customers, enhancing acquisition and cutting back customer churn.  On a base of several hundred thousands of customers across nine product lines, the team I have lead went from a yearly loss of 35,000 to a growth of 60,000 - more profitable and younger - customers per year.",

I aimed to develop strong voices in the community and create future writers, journalists, lawyers or politicians. Language development often gets in the way. So we started coaching them with writing.\nIntroduced the Burning Pen (de Brandende Pen), a new national prize for the best short story written in Dutch as a way to attract better writers and more subscribers.\nHighlights of the magazine include personally visiting writers in Peru and Bolivia, whose wonderful work we translated with Vertalersvakschool and published in Dutch. Worked with McSweeneys to publish original work by acclaimed authors like Dave Eggers, Joyce Carol Oats, Chuck Palahniuk, Yann Martel and Michael Chabon. Photographers, graphic designers and artists joined our pages to turn every publication in a literary gem.",
