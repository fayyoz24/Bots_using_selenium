I have worked for the world\u2019s top-notch agencies (a.o. Wieden + Kennedy) and brands and bring a wealth of international production, marketing and business understanding, covering the full range of storytelling and engagement: TV commercials, feature films, on-line content, web series, documentaries, and yes, even a theme park ride.\n\nMany A-level directors, Superstars and international (sports-)celebrities have worked with me and I am the only Dutch person who ever won the Grand Prix at Cannes Lions, twice.\n\nI am comfortable leading large teams, often as MT member, and I\u2019m very experienced managing various cultural teams over multi countries. I like to simplify and unravel to the core and build a construct from there.\n\nAmsterdam based, with a strong local connection, I operate anywhere in the world and have my own consultancy now; where my \u2018outside the box\u2019 approach turns out to be very successful.",
