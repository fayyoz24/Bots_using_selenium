The event usually consists of three parts: a short 'ice-breaker' introduction round to get an impression of the people present, a 30 to 45 min thorough technical presentation on a topic such as a programming language (Haskell, Scala, Lua etc) or hardware like Jeenode, LAOS (Laser Open Source) followed by a 30 to 45 min presentation of technology in a broader context like the Quantified Self movement, Open Source development practices and having fun with the Arduino Lillypad. After the presentations there's always plenty of room for some informal discussions & having a drink with eachother.",
