The movie surely didn\u2019t get any cheaper because of that. With Netify this won\u2019t ever happen again.\n\nNetify sends you a notification whenever your phone switches network types, to keep you updated on the type of network you are connected to!\n\nOnly when you want it:\nYou can tell Netify when to notify you: only want to receive a notification when your device is connected via a cellular data network, or also when connected to Wi-Fi? Netify obeys your preferences!\n\nExactly how you want it:\nCustomize Netify completely to your liking: don\u2019t want Netify notifications to vibrate, play a sound or blink your notification LED? The settings in Netify leave you in charge!\n\nBe on time:\nWith the notifications from Netify you can quickly open your cellular data or Wi-Fi settings with just one tap. Turn Wi-Fi on, or quickly disable cellular data!\n\nLook back in the past:\nWith the Netify Log you can see when, and what kind of network you were previously connected to. You can also copy and share the Netify Log with the developer or with your friends!\n\nAd-free:\nNetify is completely ad-free, to keep you happy and to give you the best possible user experience. No annoying ads that distract you or limit your screen space.\nNetify is compatible with Android 3.0 and higher.",

It started by designing in a day, and the second day the website was built and live. This website is completely designed by EkstrLabs, and was done as a voluntary project.",

You do receive the actual messages, but don't receive notifications of them when you don't want to. You can view the caught notifications later in an orderly list just as you are used to when receiving normal notifications.\n\nThe app turns all visual and physical aspects (like vibrating, sound and a screen that turns on) off while a SnoozIT! session is running. And you are in charge! For example: you can tell the app to catch notifications of Facebook, while still letting phone calls ring. Or even the other way around! You can also set the desired length of a session whenever you start a new session.\n\nThe most important features:\n- Catching the notifications of the apps which you tell SnoozIT! to\n- Starting a new SnoozIT! session with a desired length or indefinitely\n- Snoozing for up to 60 minutes after a session's time ran out\n- Viewing your notifications in an accessible and orderly list",
