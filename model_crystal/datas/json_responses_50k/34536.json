    "summary": "Currently studying a British Psychological Society (BPS) accredited MSc in Health Psychology after having obtained graduate membership status (GMBPsS) with the BPS. My commitment in pursuing a career promoting physical and mental well-being builds upon past clinical experience as a registered nurse and volunteer positions with vulnerable members of the community. \n\nReturning to the United Kingdom after relocations to Norway and the Netherlands, as a consequence I have found that my personal and professional identity has positively evolved through new challenges and opportunities. \n\nI consider my communication skills as a main strength, where within all stages of my employment history I have been mindful of demonstrating an approachable persona while respecting different cultures and personalities.",
