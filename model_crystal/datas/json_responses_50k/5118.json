    "summary": "In my previous position as Financial integration manager at TSH, I was responsible for the integration of newly acquired companies into the TSH group. Within approximately 100 days I made sure the following was achieved:\n- Financials are of sufficient consistency and quality to be included in the monthly group consolidation;\n- Financial- and non-financial KPIs are consistent and included in the quarterly group reporting;\n- Setup of a business reporting process and handing the monthly process over to the controller;\n- On-boarding of the former owners/MDs within the TSH group; and\n- Identify performance improvement opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, I worked on ad hoc performance improvement projects covering all business units within the TSH group.\n\nBefore this I was a Manager in the PwC deals department in Amsterdam, where I had a project team leadership role, responsible for supporting clients through the due diligence stages for various types of transactions. This position required teamwork and helped me to further develop my knowledge and experience in performing thorough business analyses, and analyzing forecasts/budgets. As well as gaining experience in coaching my fellow team members and interacting with customers. Serving as a problem solver, answering the key questions our clients had related to the deal.\nAdditionally, I had a role as a Data Analytics specialist within the deals department.\n\nBefore this position I was an auditor (RA) for over five years, servicing mainly large US listed clients on group teams in a highly international environment.",
