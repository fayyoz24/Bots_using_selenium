It allows for people to find, review and share the restaurants they would go to. Starting with little practical knowledge in the technologies used, I first learned how to develop the UI of the app and it's logic, then the API and the database. This allowed me to fulfill my tasks efficiently from the beginning to the end and have a more global vision of the modifications for a better plan of action. Working with the team of The PIQ made me more efficient, not only because it gave me a real challenge, but also because it served as a reminder that the easier a feature is to use, the longer a team spent working on it.",
