This advice included drafting of MoU and Letters of Intent, acquisition agreements, shareholders agreements, post-completion work, price adjustments and warranties\u00b4 claims, etc. \n\nMy firm led the advice on the sale by a Spanish listed Infrastructure Group of a European energy division with assets in different European countries (approx.value: EUR 100M). \n\nI represented one of the leading Spanish listed Companies as shareholder in one of the largest insolvency proceedings in Europe. \n\nI led strategic legal advice on an ICC arbitration abroad and related settlement and advised on international agreements and joint ventures, as well as construction, engineering and FIDIC agreements, etc. \n\nI advised Spanish Companies on legal structures to grow in the US and other American countries through P3 Projects, optimising the financing needed for this purpose. \n\nI continued involved in pro-bono work and advice to clients on CSR matters.",
