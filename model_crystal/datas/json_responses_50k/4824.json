    "summary": "Since 2002 I represent Be Advice | Vivium zorggroep. I am one of the founders of The Hogeweyk. \nMany highly regarded international media widely reported on the Hogeweyk and my work e.g. Times, Times Magazine, CNN, CBS, ARD, Die Zeit, BBC, The Guardian, The Economist, Le Figaro.\n\nWe use our Be Advice Paradigm\u00a9 to create together with our clients unique communities for people, whether they are living with dementia or not. Examples of projects inspired and guided by our Be Advice Paradigm\u00a9 you will find in The Netherlands, France, Norway, Italy, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA. We started a movement with a different way of thinking and acting, please take a look at www.bethecareconcept.com/en/impact-through-vision/\n\nConsumer behaviour has fascinated me from an early age.  What would you want when you get older? How would you want to live? Who is happy living in an institution, and who isn\u2019t? The older adults as consumers. The multidisciplinary master\u2019s in Consumer Sciences at Wageningen University & Research with a focus on management, economics and sociology was a logical addition to my studies in Facility Management. For years, I have been working with this experience and a lot of dedication to improving the living environment and care for older consumers with and without dementia. I create a tangible and visible level of quality and joie de vivre as a choice, in addition to good care and support. Disrupting traditional care models.\n\nSince 2010 I have my own advisory firm Van Hal Adviespraktijk BV as well. I advise national and international healthcare facilities, firms, and governments about vitality, ageing and a life with dementia. Since 2018 I am appointed as Supervisor Villaggio Emmanuele F.M. Emanuele, Fondazione Roma, Italy.\n\nIn summary, I have over 25 years\u2019 experience in managing care (among which The Hogeweyk) and more than 15 years in providing strategic and operational advisory services to clients in the public and private sectors. I have worked on a range of projects all over the world, influencing, engaging and advising stakeholders. I bring a strong understanding of innovative care concepts for people living with dementia and lots of experience in age care from all over the world. \n\n\nExpertise: \nThe Hogeweyk community and The Hogeweyk care concept\nBe Advice Paradigm\u00a9: operationalising Quality of Life using 7 Pillars and 4 Domains\nCommunity building for older adults\nConcept Development\nDementia care \nInnovative Care management\nStakeholder engagement\nKeynote Speaker",
