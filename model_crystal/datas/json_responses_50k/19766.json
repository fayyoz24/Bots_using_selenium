    "summary": "I firmly believe that we all possess the perfect solutions to overcome the challenges we encounter today. Sometimes, we just require a little bit of guidance to bring these solutions to light.\n\nWelcome to my Linkedin Network ; my name is Jan Oldenziel. \n\nOver the course of my professional career, I have worked as a Senior Consultant and Manager for various financial institutions for over two decades. In the last seven years, I had the privilege of being a member of the management team for a global consultancy firm.\n\nAs I progressed up the career ladder, it became more and more clear to me that I wanted to apply my talents and passion in a new way, leveraging my professional and managerial experience. In 2007, I took the leap and became an independent organizational coach, establishing my own company, \"Change in Progress\" a few months later in May 2008.\n\nPresently, many businesses are undergoing massive transformation processes, and there is a need for a fresh approach to leadership, change, sales, and a renewed commitment from employees. My primary objective is to support organizations dealing with these challenges. I work collaboratively with individuals and organizations to realize their full potential by providing facilitation, coaching, and organizational consulting.\n\nEach company has its unique culture, communication style, and values. As a specialist in the world of finance and professional services, I provide assistance to promote self-awareness, equip you with the right tools, and offer processes to aid you in achieving your objectives!\n\nRecent projects : ING, Adyen, Booking.com, Heineken, KLM, Nationale-Nederlanden, EY, BCG, Delta Lloyd, PWC, Deutsche Bank, KPMG, Kone, and Royal Flora-Holland.\n\nSpecialties: Executive coaching, organisation culture change, change management, Qualified in Myers-Briggs Type Indicator\u00ae (MBTI\u00ae), Organizational and Team Culture Indicator\u2122 , \nThomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI), DISC\u2122",
