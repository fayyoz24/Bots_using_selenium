    "summary": "As a recruiter, I have the privilege of playing a part in shaping people's lives and careers. And there's nothing more rewarding than seeing someone's face light up when they hear the words \"Congratulations, you got the job!\".\n\nThroughout my career, I have seen firsthand the impact that the right opportunity can have on a person's life. Given my background in social sciences, I have a deeper understanding on the importance of providing equal opportunities to under-represented groups.\n\nThat's why I am passionate about diversity hiring and strive to provide equal opportunities for those who are underrepresented in the tech industry. I am dedicated to understanding the skills and qualifications required for success in tech roles and matching talented individuals with their dream jobs while helping companies build inclusive and diverse teams that drive innovation and growth.\n\nPersonally, I like singing, playing the guitar, cooking, and watching analysis videos of movies/series. I'd like to think I'm MacGyver because I always come up with the most creative solutions to first-world-problems \u263a\ufe0f",
