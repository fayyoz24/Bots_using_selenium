The project was based on combating online gender-based violence. In the process, I worked with 12 other students on drafting and editing a report that would indicate to the organization the areas in need of action to improve access to justice for women and girls experiencing online and technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Thanks to this course I gained clearer insights on the issue of OGBV and I developed better skills in formulating and promoting strategies to empower women and enhance gender equality. Moreover, the teamwork has provided a challenge and improved my communication and collaboration skills in a large and diverse group.",
