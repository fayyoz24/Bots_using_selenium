    "summary": "For Entrepreneurs and CEOs who want to accelerate scaling, I am the reliable partner to help you to create a streamlined and futureproof organization. \n\nDid you know that 70% of companies that want to scale fail? Mostly because of a lack of expertise on how to scale up systematically.\n\nMasters of Scale helps fast-growing start-ups to successfully scale by supporting them to develop a scaling strategy, solve challenges and if needed raise a funding round. We do this with an international team of experienced entrepreneurs (\u201cMasters\u201d) and Experts with a shared passion for accelerating entrepreneurship and with proven experience in setting up, scaling up, financing and selling companies.\n\nNext to being co-founder of Masters of Scale, I support our customer to create streamlined and futureproof organizations (structure and processes), increase employee productivity and embed execution discipline. Resulting in an organization that is a well-oiled machine with strong execution power that is ready to achieve accelerated scaling. \n\nMy organizational skills and structured yet flexible, results-oriented mindset mean I always want to bring order in the chaos, create simplicity from complexity and set clear priorities. I am not satisfied until I deliver high quality results and am extremely dependable. I am passionate about being creative and active both in work and personal life and continually seek out new challenges and dynamic environments.\n\nI'm always open to sparring so feel free to reach out! \n\nStrategy Execution | Strategy Implementation | Operational Excellence | Business Improvement | Process Improvement | Lean Six Sigma Black Belt | Strategy Development | Problem-solving | Change Management | Program Management | Project Management",

Has your team increased in size so quickly that you don\u2019t know who\u2019s doing what? Then Nearwater Consultancy is the consultant to help you professionalize and accelerate. We understand that entrepreneurs and leaders of growing organizations can often feel as if they are drowning in challenges. Challenges like strategic direction, innovation, cash flow, cost management, inefficiencies, hiring and more. \n\nWHAT: Nearwater Consultancy supports small and medium-sized organizations to achieve Operational Excellence while always keeping employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 needs in mind. We look at an organization along all elements of our Operational Excellence Framework: \n\u2022Foundation: Strategy, Organization Structure, Processes & Systems, Products & Services\n\u2022Enablers: Performance Management, Leadership, People & Culture, Continuous Improvement, Risk & Quality Management\n\nWe identify improvement opportunities and develop a prioritized action plan. If needed, we can oversee the implementation of the entire plan or specific actions within the plan. Finally, we embed our knowledge in the organization to establish a continuous improvement culture. \n\nHOW: Depending on the size of the organization, we spend between 1-3 months gaining a deep understanding of the organization to develop a solid analysis and realistic plan. During this period, we immediately identify and implement quick wins and embed Operational Excellence knowledge through workshops and trainings. \n\nRESULTS: Our approach allows organizations to (further) professionalize and remove inefficiencies, thereby clearing the path for continued growth. We have streamlined hundreds of processes to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction. We have implemented dozens of projects to embed changes in organizations. Finally, we have inspired hundreds of people to embrace a continuous improvement mindset.",
