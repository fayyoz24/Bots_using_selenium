The COIL Center has developed an approach to fostering faculty and student exchange through the development of co-taught multicultural online and blended learning environments that link classes at SUNY with those at universities around the world.\n\nTogether with Gregg Bray (SUNY New Paltz, USA) and Jon Rubin ( Director of COIL, SUNY, USA) we developed a collaborative online course in video and web production. Media students from The Netherlands and from New Paltz worked together for 10 weeks on a collaborative assignment i.e. a promotional video and a website concept.  Students communicated and worked together by using Skype, Facebook and email.  The classes were divided up into six groups of four. Each group consisted of two US students and two Dutch students. Throughout the 10 weeks students (and lecturers) overcome challenges of working in not only a virtual team but also an intercultural one. The group who created the best final product won a trip to the US and The Netherlands to visit their virtual classmates.  The Dutch and US students also presented their work at the COIL conference which was held in New York in March 2015. \n\nIn the winning group's video, students tell their story from and American and Dutch perspective. The final product can be found here: https://vimeo.com/123977257 \n\n\n\n\n\n",
