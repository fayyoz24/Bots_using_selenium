            "description": "Virtual manufacturing systems can provide useful means for products to be manufactured without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. There are many errors in CNC machine tools have effect on the accuracy and repeatability of manufacture. Most of these errors are based on specific parameters such as the strength and the stress, the dimensional deviations of the structure of the machine tool, thermal variations, cutting force induced errors and vibration.\nThe thesis aims to investigate a methodology to forecast the overall manufacturing error in CNC machine. It takes into account different sources of errors ranging from geometrical errors, thermal deformation, static and dynamic load, and more. On the basis of the scientific literature available on the subject, the thesis will provide a conceptual model to merge the error contributors. The conceptual model will be applied to a specific CNC milling machine in order to carry out a virtual manufacturing model. The virtual model will be implemented in CAx environment based on Siemens software. The virtual model and its software implementation will provide an estimation of the overall manufacturing error. The error estimation will be compared with the real manufacturing CNC machine (Bridgeport GX 1000 Vertical Machining Center) available in Siemens facility\n",
