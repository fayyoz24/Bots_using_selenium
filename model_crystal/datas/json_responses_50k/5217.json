    "summary": "Early 2023, I graduated from my MSc Strategic Entrepreneurship after finishing a great exchange at the Wharton Business School. Ever since, I have tried to take on opportunities which would push me out of my comfort zone. \n\nFor example, I have travelled solo to Thailand and Indonesia in order to learn how to connect to people quickly and know what it is like to fully rely on myself in a foreign country. \n\nAdditionally, I wanted to improve my sales skills since I believe it is a fundamental skill in life. Therefore, I took on two freelance jobs in different industries from which I have been able to learn a lot. I started out as an inexperienced, shy salesperson and have grown into the \u201ccloser\u201d of the day during our sales competition in August. \n\nThis summer I also decided to go skydiving with my friends when on holiday in Italy. I have always been afraid of heights and this really pushed me over the edge, literally and figuratively. \n\nAll-in-all, I am always trying to develop myself professionally and personally.",
