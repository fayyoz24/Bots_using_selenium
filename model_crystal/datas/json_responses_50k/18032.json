The research investigated to which extent existing bacterial communities inhibit the growth of two plant-parasitic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium culmorum) by means of anti-microbial volatile production. Bacterial populations were sampled in different soil environments. An important finding was that soil moisture clearly influences the bacterial population's ability to inhibit fungal growth. The research has shown that bacterial volatiles play an important role in competitive interactions in unsaturated soils. This knowledge can be applied to increase soil resistance and protect agricultural crops and weeds from fungal infection. ",

The research focused on the plant's ability to defend itself against herbivory. Wild crucifer Brassica nigra can show a direct and an indirect defence when induced by egg deposition of cabbage white butterflies (Pieris). The first one kills the eggs by inducing local cell necrosis at oviposition site, leading the egg to dehydrate and fall of the leaf. The second defence mechanism is the release of oviposition-induced plant volaties that can attracting parasitoid wasps. The genetic expression of two genetic pathways involved in the plant's defence (JA and SA) after 24h and 72h has been investigated. On top, we performed behavioural (Y-tube) experiments with Trichogramma parasitoid wasps to test the plant's attractiveness. Based on these experiments it is suggested that the JA signalling pathway could play an iportant role in the indirect plant defence of Brassica Nigra.\n\n",

The mass-flowering leek fields are pollinated by  honey bees (Apis mellifera), syrphids, wild bees and wasps. How is the composition of the landscape around the leek fields affecting the diversity and numbers of wild pollinators in and around the leek fields?\n\nMethods\nSpecies data (solitary bees, bumblebees, honey bees, wasps and syrphids) were collected inside the fields and in the surrounding habitat. Pollinator compositions in the landscape before and during the flowering of the leek were compared to research possible spillover effects. GIS derived landscape variables were linked to this data. \n\nResults\nIt is shown that the presence of woodlands enhances pollinator populations (mostly bumblebee numbers) in the landscape \u00e1nd leek fields, while road verges and flower density increase pollinator diversity in the landscape. This emphasizes the importance of suitable landscape elements for wild bees. It is the first time that this is shown for a pollination system in Southern Europe.",

However, the presence and abundance of wild pollinator species strongly depends on the quality of the landscape. Species Distribution Models (SDM) can determine what landscape parameters are driving species occurrence and can predict the spatial distribution of the species.  \nIn this study the 3D configuration of the AHN2 point cloud was used to derive information about the vegetation structure in the Southern part of the Netherlands. This was used to predict the distribution of 60 different wild bee species living in the Netherlands. \nThe predicted species richness map appeared to be more reliable than the map based on a classical approach with land use variables only. Landscape heterogeneity and edge length between natural and managed areas appeared to be important drivers of species richness. This study shows that LiDAR derived vegetation structure can be a valuable source for mapping invertebrate species on national scales.",

Data have been acquired in Sukumba (Mali) for model development and to create reference datasets for spectral, temporal and textural libraries. This internship showed how UAV imagery can be used in small-scale agriculture in West-Africa.\n\nFor this research my working activities comprised:\n- Operating drone flights (eBee)\n- Radiometric correction;\n- Geometric correction;\n- Local coordination of the field measurements;\n- Handling operational issues;\n- Data Quality Control.\nGrade: 9.0",
