    "summary": "Hi there, thank you for stopping by :)\n\nIf you're here, then I'll just introduce myself! My name is Hoang Anh, a 24-year old Communication graduate at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Coming from Vietnam, I appreciate the opportunity to study in an international environment and gaining many different experiences working in international firms. \n\nI decided to pursue Marketing-communication as my profession during my high school years. I thought the experience of managing a high-school club, organizing events and working with sponsors were quite fun, and somewhat coincide with what we do in Marketing-Communication. So, I chose my major and went with it. My experiences in the Netherlands had lead me to follow the path of digital marketing. Through my times working as both intern and junior marketer, I have learned about various aspects of digital marketing such as:\n\n\u2022 Social media and search advertising\n\u2022 SEO and content marketing\n\u2022 Marketing automation\n\u2022 Campaign management\n\u2022 Data analytics and Data-Driven Marketing \n\u2022 A bit of Growth Hacking\n\n\nI particularly like data analytics and how we can use data to better help us in marketing activities. I think E-commerce can also be something I would like to get into. But for now and the upcoming years, I want to grow into a well-rounded digital marketer who knows his stuff! With the orientation visa approval, I can finally come back to the Netherlands and look for new challenges there. \n\nYou're still reading this? Wow, thank you for your time! Please feel free to hit the connect button, we just might collaborate some days :)",

I also was assigned to manage the club's relationship with several sponsors.\nI enjoyed my time at the club, and the experience at the club was so exciting that it motivated me to choose a profession/career with elements of communication and creativity.",
