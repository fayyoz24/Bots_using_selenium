Up to date though there has not been a direct examination of identifying sensation seeking and self-control as mediating factors in the relationship between narcissistic personality traits and substance use. In the current study, 100 females and 43 males were measured on overt and covert narcissism, our mediator\u2019s sensation seeking and self-control, and our substance use variables. Overt and covert narcissism predicted sensation seeking and self-control for consuming alcohol, use of marijuana and smoking. In addition, sensation seeking only partially mediated overt narcissism in alcohol consumption, whereas covert narcissism was mediated by self-control in alcohol consumption. Furthermore, both sensation seeking and self-control mediated the relationship between overt narcissism and marijuana use but not between covert narcissism. These findings provide support for the independent route overt and covert narcissism follow towards substance use, and indicate the need for additional research on how they share common behavioral outcomes of substance use. Whereas overt narcissists seem to actively seek out and pursue the thrills of new experiences among which substance use, covert narcissists seem to display an inability to resist the temptation of using substances.",
