The specific focus of this research is on lettuce cultivation in an NFT hydroponics system within a greenhouse setup.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this study is to measure and analyze various parameters including yields, quality, shelf life, and light energy use efficiency. By conducting experiments with four different lettuce cultivars and testing them on two different substrates, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of EOD additional lighting on lettuce production.\r\n\r\nThis research project plays a crucial role in advancing the field of leaf crop innovation and contributes towards promoting sustainable and efficient practices within the agricultural industry. Its outcomes will provide valuable insights into optimizing lettuce cultivation techniques, ultimately leading to improved crop yields and overall productivity.",

The experiment is conducted in a vertical farming setup inside a growth chamber, with the aim of checking gene expression to better understand the plants' circadian rhythm.\n\nTo accomplish this, I studied the diel oscillation patterns of core clock genes and output genes of the circadian clock under both normal 24-hour cycles and abnormal diel cycles. Through this research, I hope to gain insight into how plants respond to changes in day length and how this affects their circadian rhythm.\n\nThis project has implications for the field of vertical farming and may lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable practices. By better understanding the circadian rhythm of plants grown in vertical farms, we can optimize growth and yield while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nThis research was a small part of 'Sky High: Vertical farming, a revolution in plant production' which is an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and companies that investigates many aspects of vertical farming from plant physiological research.",
