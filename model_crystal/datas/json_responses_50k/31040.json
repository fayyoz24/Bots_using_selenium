Or what it can mean to the viewer?\nIt can be considered all of these things or none of them at all. Photography at its core is about capturing a moment, a split-second encounter that wants to be remembered and immortalised in an image. What role does the photographer\u2019s choice of medium play in someone appreciating the art form? That\u2019s what I have studied to reach a deeper understanding of the double standards within photography and understand why one medium results in a \u2018better\u2019 photograph than the other. Understanding what role technological evolution has played in those expectations.\n\nIn doing this effectively, I chose Motorsport as my first case study, over the last few years there has been a drastic change in focus on the sustainable future of motorsport, Formula E was the FIA\u2019s1 solution to starting and maintaining this conversation in FIA-affiliated sports.\n\nAlong with exploring the visual juxtaposition of the two different mediums as well as aspects of the series as a whole, I also studied the evolution of the advertisements and sponsorships plastered across the car chassis\u2019 and driver suits throughout history, exploring how advertisements and sponsorships have changed and impacted motorsport through the evolution of the sport and the rapid changes of photographic technology.",
