    "summary": "Throughout my life, I embody a scientific approach. Combining sources from Clinical-, Developmental-, Sport-psychology and Design thinking I focus on changing habits, training skills, personalizing education and systematically documenting this progress for later referral. I analyze and model human behavior through the lens of dynamical network models, where individual differences are not disregarded but celebrated and within-subject-analyses become possible. \n\nMindfulness-Based Stress reduction and coaching practices have had a positive influence on my life. Allowing me to better understand myself, giving me controle to step out of negative behavioral patterns and learn new habits. I found that having a strong foundation (Maslow Hierarchy of needs) and supporting systems for learning, reflecting and documenting progress have been an enormous help during difficult times. The data and workflows gave me confidence in my day to day life even when I felt anxious and insecure. \n\nMy goal: Helping others develop the skills and confidence necessary to independently develop exceptional performance and creativity. Providing them with a supportive system so, they can achieve their personal goals while feeling content.\n\nIf you are looking for excellence, health and a satisfying life. Reach out and see how you can set up a strong foundation for exceptional creativity and performance.",
