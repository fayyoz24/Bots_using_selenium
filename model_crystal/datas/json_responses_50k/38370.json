The themes and topics of lectures, breakout sessions and films or workshop presentations included: bearing witness through storytelling, developing a strong ethical compass, transcending trauma, and taking responsibility for one another. The week-long conference was a great success through its vast discussions on the role of ethics in today's technologically- advanced world.",
