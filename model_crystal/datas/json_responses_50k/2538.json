With a cast of over 200 people and backstage team of over 75 people, this performace was immense and put the university on the agenda of technical innovation and cultural challenges. Within hours all 5 performences were sold out, meaning the story of the femme fatale Carmen shown in the arena of the Technical University in Delft has reached over 5000 visitors. \n\nWithin this ambitious and intense project I was responsible for the logistics, decor and constumes. I also funtioned as production leader during the period of rehearsals and performances. The audience was adored by our new and modern performance of the opera Carmen. Which gave us the confidence that the objective was reached to show a broad variety of people that opera is of all times and pleasant as well.",
