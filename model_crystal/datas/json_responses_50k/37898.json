    "summary": "I grew up in South Africa and started my career in Nelson Mandela's Rainbow Nation. I've had the privilege of working alongside Primary Health Care Workers during the peak of the AIDS epidemic in the country. This experience deepened my understanding of the importance of their work.\nMy passion lies at the intersection of open source software, open data, and the application of open development principles to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. I'm an experienced digital producer and a specialist in Human-Centered Design. I've worked with OpenStreetMap Senegal to develop Impact orientated citizen science projects.\nOne of my proudest achievements is founding and spearheading the The Global Healthsites Mapping Project - healthsites.io  in direct response to the West African Ebola outbreak. healthsites.io stands as a Digital Public Good, meticulously curating health facility data with the power of citizen science and OpenStreetMap. \nAt the heart of our work lies an innovative Emergency Health Mapping Campaign method. This approach supports the Ministry of Health and embraces Human-Centered Design principles, incorporating citizen engagement to improve baseline health facility data.\nMy contributions extend to academic papers that delve into our groundbreaking work and underscore the pivotal role of accurate health facility data in effectively responding to disease outbreaks. I've successfully secured development funding, firmly establishing healthsites.io as a respected Digital Public Good.\nTogether with OpenStreetMap Senegal we've established a data collaborative approach that is supporting the Ministry of Health to maintenance of the Ministries Master Facility List.\nWe\u2019re building the tools and community to share and update health facility data. Get in touch and help us scale this transformative approach to maintaining accurate baseline of health facility data for all stakeholders.",
