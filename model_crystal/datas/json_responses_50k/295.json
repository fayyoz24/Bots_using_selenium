    "summary": "General\n\nI started my IT career as programmer / analyst and followed the classical path to designer, business analyst, architect, project leader and finally became IT manager.\nThe major part (24 years) of my career I worked for the (NYSE) Euronext stock/option exchange in Amsterdam.  \nI attributed to a successful merger of the Amsterdam exchange with the Paris and Brussels exchange and later also with the New York exchange.  The last 4 years at the exchange I was also responsible for the local (NL) Business Continuity (BC), SLA\u2019s, Office Automation and the Security issues (IT and non-IT). \nI helped to set-up the BC platform for the Dutch financial services together with the Dutch National Bank.  \n\nMy origin in IT is software development but I have also done projects for training, computer-network, office automation, digital media and digital audio- and video-conferences. I have completed local and international projects. I am an all-round experienced IT person with proven international (project) management track record. \n\nAfter my \"regular working life\" at the Exchange, I started a different life. Financially independent, I had more time to take care for my family. I worked on many short time projects as subcontractor via Activsys in the Netherlands and abroad. This where mainly migration projects.\nLast years due to the pandemic, I did a language translation job which also include testing, development of translation support software and roll-out of Home Automation system (Alarm, Smarthome to Elderness care).\n\nNow after the kids have left home for study/work and having seen the whole of Europe with my wife, I am open for a new challenge helping e.g. a non-profit organization to achieve their goals.\n\nMain competences:\n- Very analytic, flexible and learn fast.\n-  \u201cPeople manager\u201d, that looks also to the result.\n-  Approach a project from a business perspective and translate it to IT-requirements.\n- Try to practice or understand the work I manage.  So I have \"IT hands-on\" experience in\n   Software development  - Help-desk - Support - IT maintenance -IT delivery - \n   networks - hardware -  mobile devices - several OS (W7/W8/W10, Ubuntu-Linux,\n   Unix, Z/OS) - Microsoft office - etc..  \n- Deliver reliable, solid but flexible quality solutions.\n- Honest and open to my staff and my management.\n- Practical person that decides and takes responsibility and respects procedures and law.\n- Communicate on operational and strategic level with business and IT .\n- Familiar with ITIL, Agile, Scrum, DevOps, General Data Protection Regulation\n  (GDPR, Dutch AVG).",
