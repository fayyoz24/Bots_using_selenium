    "summary": "I am an energetic and driven energy professional with experience in both the technical and the non-technical domain. In my current role I am continuously looking for ways to support Shell Nederland in contributing to the Dutch society in fulfilling the local energy needs. I help to find solutions in the context of the Shell Group Strategy and actively seek for opportunities in the energy domain on a global scale. As a production technologist I have gained deep insights in the Upstream Oil & Gas business with thorough understanding of the sub-surface and surface technical disciplines and the interfaces and integration between them. My skills in connecting technical and non-technical domains, being able to communicate in a clear and effective manner and inspiring others to contribute as well, help me to be effective in one of the most challenging and relevant domains for society: energy, now and in the future.",

This model can then be used to find the optimal balance between the operational performance, costs and possible other factors such as system safety. As a next step the results from this model are translated to standards in order to be used as a baseline for daily business.",
