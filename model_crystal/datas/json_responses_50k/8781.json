    "summary": "I am native Dutch, which I both speak and write at a respectable level. I speak German (partly growing up in Austria) and English (near native) My area of expertise has been within \nimmigration the last ten years of my life. I have obtained knowledge of the Dutch foreigner law and Dutch nationality law (and related affairs), through my years at the IND, having my own immigration consulting firm for 5 years and perhaps most importantly, through  \npersonal experience. This does however not define me, as my interests are broad. I have worked also a freelance journalist, communication officer, among other jobs (which are not all to be found here).",
