I have worked abroad (Germany, Spain, UK, Switzerland, Poland and France) a lot to perform measurements and calculations that were not possible in our own research lab. All research results have been published in highly regarded scientific journals. \n\nMy PhD focused on the development of  time-resolved methodologies to allow the characterization of all reaction intermediates in time, including short-lived active species. We focused on industrially important systems, like, hydrogen production, ethene selective oligomerization/polymerization and C-C/C-X cross couplings reactions. The influence of the ligand on the catalyst performance is significant for all, but poor mechanistic insights and the lack of structure-reactivity relationships hamper understanding and further development. Detailed spectroscopic studies into the structure and electronics of the catalysts during function are essential to develop these systems in a rational manner.",

Noteworthy, first de-esterification of apple pectin using base treatment for several days, resulted in higher yields of esterification in the esterification process. By the use of gel electrophoresis, the different samples could be analyzed and discriminated on different methylation patterns, created by different methods. The additional use of H-NMR, confirming the assumptions made on gel-electrophoresis results, made it possible to develop/ increase the library of pectin distributions for future research. The H-NMR measurements involved procedures like suppressing water signals. \n\nAdditional research was conducted towards the covalent coupling of pectin towards a resin for optical tweezers experiment. Several light induced reactions were tested with minimum results. Fluorescent labelling of pectin was accomplished in the desired 1 in a 100 monomers ratio in high yields. A simple purification method was established by ethanol precepatation at low temperatures followed by vacuum-drying. Techniques used in this project are enzyme procedures (pectin Lyase Aspergillus Niger and Orange/plant), chemical procedures involved sulfuric acid., Freeze drying, High \u2013 tech Centrifuge using different membranes, Chemical Synthesis, Gel-Electrophoresis, H-NMR, MS-Spectroscopy, IR-Spectroscopy.",

The synthesis of small even distributed hydrogels consisting of neutral thermal sensitive monomers, a crosslinker and a cationic and anionic polymer was successful in high yields. The results showed greatly improved adsorption isotherms (binding affinity / calcium concentration) compared to alternative techniques like bulk-synthesis. Furthermore, the process was optimized (e.g.) by controlling the reaction conditions as water/oil ratio and the equivalent of reactants. The morphology was determined by microscopy, revealing the size distribution of the batches, analyzed by Student's t-distribution. Techniques used in this research: (inverse) Suspension polymerization, (Light) Microscopy, FT-IR, Titrations and calcium binding affinity calculations.",
