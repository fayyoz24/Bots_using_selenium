With the practical we introduce the students to the possibilities offered by photoacoustics in an accessible way.\n\nGoal: With our plan we hoped not only to increase awareness of photoacoustic detection techniques, but also to generate enthusiasm for science and technology in young people, even before they select their subject cluster.\n\nOn October 23th, we presented our plan to the jury, the media and an audience in the Winkel van Sinkel in Utrecht.\n\nThe 'Academische Jaarprijs' is an initiative of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and NRC Handelsblad. The 'Academische Jaarprijs' was introduced in order to motivate scientists and students to bring their research to the attention of a wide audience, or to the attention of specific target groups, such as young people.\nFollowing the first round, a total of 17 teams were left in the competition for the main prize: 100000 euro.\n\nWe received the public price for our plan.
