    "summary": "As a Researcher at Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship (ECE), I specialize in cultural entrepreneurship and female leadership, uncovering the latest research insights and trends in these domains. I also contribute to the data collection and analysis of the ScaleUp Dashboard and the European Scaleup Monitor, which provide valuable information on the scaleup ecosystem in the Netherlands and Europe.\n\nI hold a master's degree in Cultural Economics & Entrepreneurship from Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, where I participated in various programs and courses related to creative entrepreneurship, impact assessment, and effective altruism. Previously, I worked as a Policy Trainee and Research Assistant at Culture Action Europe, where I advocated for the sustainability and resilience of the cultural and creative sectors in the EU. I am passionate about entrepreneurial practices, innovation, and social impact, and I aim to support and empower the cultural and creative industries through my research and advocacy work.",
