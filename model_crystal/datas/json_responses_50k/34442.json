    "summary": "\"It's not the load that breaks you down; it's the way you carry it.\"\n\nDedicated to being a positive force, I'm a strategic planner who devises innovative solutions to complex business challenges. I excel in multinational environments and have built my career around my passion for people and the inland shipping industry. I take pride in leading a team of intelligent, passionate, and critical thinkers who embrace challenges instead of avoiding them.\n\nAs the head of nautical operations for 66 vessels and 1,200 officers and crew, I oversee a team of 14 Field Officers and 16 Office Executives. We strive to provide exceptional service to our guests through safe navigation, digital communications, and nautical performance management.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience as a captain on various river vessels, I am a fully qualified Master Mariner, holding all necessary licenses to operate inland waterway vessels in Europe and a limited marine license for ocean-going ships.\n\nSince joining Viking in 2015, I have had the unique opportunity to develop my professional skills while working in various managerial positions across the company. Some of my key accomplishments include the following:\n\nEstablishing and managing Viking College Maritime, a one-of-a-kind education program focused on newcomer training, talent development, and ongoing education\nCreating and implementing the Viking Safety Management System, the first-ever designated safety system for the inland cruise industry\nCoordinating professional development and internal promotion systems based on assessment courses for newcomers and officers\nLaunching a recertification program for seagoing officers to address the growing nautical crew shortage and facilitate entry into the river cruise industry\n\nOutside of the office and business travel, I cherish spending time outdoors with family, friends, and colleagues.",
