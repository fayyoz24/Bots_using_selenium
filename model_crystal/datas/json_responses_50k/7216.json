Each area has a particular medium, media type or cultural practice as its primary point of departure for in-depth study.

With a grant of 4.9 million euros from the Dutch Research Agenda, an interdisciplinary consortium led by cultural historian Rachel Gillett (Utrecht University) can tackle these questions. In the project Re/Presenting Europe: Popular Representations of Diversity and Belonging, education and research from postcolonial and globalising perspectives play a major role. Through a grassroots approach, with close collaboration between scholars and community-based organisations, the project endeavours to make knowledge within major academic and cultural institutions more inclusive.",
