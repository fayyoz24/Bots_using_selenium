Stomachs of 79 individuals, total length (LT) of 23-90 cm, were analysed to investigate the effect of size and sex on the diet. Variations in the diet were compared between individuals of <50 cm, 50-70 cm and >70 cm, predominately determined by stage of maturity. Ontogenetic shift was observed where smaller rays (<50 cm LT) fed mainly on glass shrimps, Pasiphaea sp. with the largest individuals (>70 cm LT) consuming more swimming crabs, Liocarcinus sp. There was an increase in prey diversity and the evenness of the species consumed with size, with the greatest diversity observed for 50-70 cm (LT). Schoener\u2019s overlap index indicated no significant overlap when compared between all length classes and only found significant overlap for males and females of the smallest length class. Variations in the diet between males and females for the larger length classes was observed, 50-70 cm females consumed more sand eels, Ammodytes tobianus, where males consumed more glass shrimps. >70 cm LT females fed on more hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, and males, fed mainly on swimming crabs. Differences in dentition between males and females may contribute to such differences in the diet, which was novel to this study, but may also be concerned with the small sample size for larger individuals.

Here the thornback ray (Raja clavata) was used to determine preferred captive conditions via choice tests and behavioural observations. Substrate type, substrate colour, substrate depth, group size and refuge use were all used to assess usage, number of stereotypic behaviours and activity in captive born rays. Sand was the preferred choice of substrate which also brought fewer surface breaking behaviours (a possible stereotypic behaviour) compared to gravel or bare tanks. Lighter colours of sand were preferred, as were deeper depths whilst increasing group size increased possible stereotypic behaviours. Type of resting behaviour (horizontal vs vertical) also differed within experiments \u2212 rays switched from horizontal to vertical resting, on the side of the tank when using gravelled versus sandy areas of the tank. The rays in this study appeared not to use refuges. Very few published studies have focused on what aquatic animals want, here we use preference tests, which are a useful way of determining what the animal wants, and can help aquarists provide the best conditions for captive thornback rays.",

            "description": "I began volunteering with the National Trust as a lake ecology assistant controlling invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) populations as part of a project run by Cefas. Crayfish were trapped weekly and morphological data were recorded before culling and disposal. This role developed into a residential volunteer ranger where I shadowed rangering staff and lead groups of volunteers for woodland management, undertaking tasks such as scrub clearance and ensuring health and safety procedures are followed when in the field and using equipment."
