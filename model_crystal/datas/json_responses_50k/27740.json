This is a farm park based in Poole mainly geared towards 2 to 8 year olds.\n\nI mainly helped with events that took place throughout the summer, and in particular assisted in planning the opening event for a new play area which opened in September 2014. In addition to this I had been set a task of creating multiple surveys, each geared towards different sectors of our market (i.e. annual pass holders, birthday party mums and pre-schools/nurseries). These surveys were created to find out their thoughts on various aspects of the farm park. Also, when needed, I helped out in the farm park Shop. Here I conversed with customers, increased my customer relationship skills - took payments for annual passes/day passes and also for various shop items. In addition, I am also did admin work, i.e. updating our databases and filing.",
