    "summary": "Passionate postdoctoral researcher in \u2018Plant Systems Physiology\u2019, who since childhood, has been keenly interested in making significant contribution to the profession pursued. Accordingly, my PhD research work, that demonstrated the orchestration of organ regeneration competence by dosage of gradient expressed transcription factor, was published in one of the highly reputed journals, \u2018Cell Reports\u2019. This publication was also recommended as an article of special significance in the field of Biology by \u201cFaculty Opinions (F1000 Prime)\u201d.\nMy postdoctoral research project demonstrates the importance of epigenetic regulation of organ regeneration by histone deacetylases (HDACs), by employing single cell RNA sequencing, genetics and confocal microscopy.\nSince am at the final phase of my postdoctoral research tenure, am looking for research/teaching opportunities in reputed research universities and plant breeding/agriculture-based industries, which will enable me to take up more challenging roles and to enhance my skill set.",
