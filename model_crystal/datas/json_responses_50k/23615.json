This project outlines a mission to the Alpha Centauri system, our neighboring star system, as a technological proof of concept and scientific mission.\nThis mission will utilize directed energy technology to propel spacecraft for a journey of approximately 20 years. During the journey, the scientific payloads will conduct\ngroundbreaking research and upon reaching their destination, an assessment of the Alpha Centauri system to obtain a better understanding of the exoplanets in that system. This mission uses the ancient methods of travel and exploration, a sail and some wind, to find out what is beyond our scope of vision.",

            "description": "Gravitational microlensing is a highly effective & powerful tool in modern astronomy to study distant galaxies, detect extrasolar planets, black holes & quasars, and determine the mass of stellar objects. Therefore, predicting future microlensing events is essential to be observed at the exact moment they are happening to extract useful information. This paper aims to find future microlensing events using Gaia eDR3. A sample of 563,150 stars as potential lenses was obtained from 1.49 billion sources of Gaia eDR3, which satisfy: (1) Total proper motion>100mas/yr, (2) \nuncertainity>5 mas, (3) RUWE<2, (4) Gmag \u2260 none. Then background sources were selected close to their paths. Finally, the future positions of lenses and sources were forecasted to determine epoch and angular separation at the closest approach. A final data sample of 120,172 was selected with lenses having a background source in the vicinity of 5 arcseconds. A nested interval algorithm was created with Python to obtain a list of future microlensing events between 2016 and 2076. Also, past microlensing events were predicted from 1996 to 2016. Finally, a graphical user interface was created to facilitate further prediction of these events and was published on GitHub to be publicly accessed.",

The outermost layer of the solar atmosphere is called as, the Hot Solar Corona, which is expanding into Space. The Corona is the rim of the Sun which is visible to the naked eye. From the upper atmosphere of the sun, a stream of charged particles is released like a shockwave. Commonly known as Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).\n\nWhat we aim to achieve, is to measure the density, by analyzing their characteristics, nature, and composition, of these shockwaves containing highly charged particles and how a huge amount of energy can be extracted from it. Our aim is to devise such a mechanism which extracts the energy from these high-intensity particles, store them and hence provides us with an alternate infinite power source.\n\n",
