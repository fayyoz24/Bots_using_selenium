Just after the Bosnian war together with the community of Rheden, I helped to setup up a youth camp. The aim was to connect young people of both Bosnia and the Netherlands to discuss and learn from the war experiences. One year later I helped organizing this again but then we got the Bosnian youth to the Netherlands. These two events helped the Bosnians to get just a bit further over their war traumas and out of their isolation and was for the Dutch an important lesson in understanding and helping a complete different culture and going the extra mile for people who are heavily impacted by the war."
