    "summary": "I am a public policy and international relations generalist, currently working at the OPCW in the Office of Strategy and Policy.\n\nI recently completed my MSc in Economics and Governance as part of Leiden University's Public Administration program. My specialized courses in said program focused on policymaking in the European Union. My thesis work revolved around the underlying causes for extended SGP suspension.\n\nIn 2022, I completed my BSc (Hons.) in International Relations. My bachelor thesis focused on regional integration and European manufacturing, and my seminar work focused on the foreign and security policies of the European Union. I wrote, edited, and served as Vice-Chief for Leiden's political science magazine, DEBAT, at different times over a course of two years.",
