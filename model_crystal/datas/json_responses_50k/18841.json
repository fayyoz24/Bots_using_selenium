    "summary": "Driven and passionate Online Marketing professional with a proven track record working in Search Engine Advertising (SEA), Paid Social (Facebook, Instagram and TikTok Advertising), Display Advertising, Retargeting, LinkedIn Advertising, Youtube & Affiliate Marketing. \n\n\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\nAfter graduating from my Bachelor studies in 2016, I joined Optimizely as an international sales representative. Fresh out of University college, working at Optimizely taught me a lot, from making my first sales calls to leading meetings with potential prospects. My proficient understanding of Spanish allowed me to work globally at the age of 23 \u2013 but also made me realize that the online marketing industry has a lot of opportunities to offer. \n\nTherefore, I decided to start my partial Master's degree at the Open University in 2017 and combined this with my new job as an Afifiliate Marketing Consultant at Awin Global. Throughout my Master\u2019s degree, I had the opportunity to learn about a variety of business processes and challenges. After my graduation in April 2021, I started working as a SEA and Affiliate Marketing Consultant at Merkle (July 2021). After having gained experience in SEA, I joined fashion retail companies Ms Mode, America Today and CoolCat. Being responsible for the execution and coordination of multiple online marketing channels allowed me to learn a lot in a relatively short time. Unfortunately, due to a reorganization I had to leave the company in April 2023. Therefore, I am actively searching for a new challenge in Digital Marketing.",
