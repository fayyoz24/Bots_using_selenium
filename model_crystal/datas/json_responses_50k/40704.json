This on the project \"Participation with movement restriction: tailor made training and coaching\". See www.meedoenmetsport.nl for more information. \n\nI was coordinator of Work Package 2: Optimising the context for sport participation for children with Cerbral Palsy and DCD. This line of research was aimed at examining the expertise and competency of professionals on training and coaching of children with CP and DCD in schools and at sport clubs. This with the aim to improve the competency of sport coaches and physical activity teachers, and optimisation of the context for sport participation among children with CP and DCD. \n\nStudied were, to what extent and in which way implicit- and explicit learning strategies are being used by sport coaches and physical activity teachers, and which experiences both professionals and children have during the use of both strategies. Besides that, the interaction between the sport professional and the child was investigated, which also included the behaviour of both target groups. The focus was on unravelling the meaning that both professionals and children give to the way the sport trainer/ PA-teacher interacts with the children.",
