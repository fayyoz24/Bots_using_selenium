I served as the co-spokesperson (see www.cern.ch/MEDIPIX), and as a member of the Scientific Committee for the International Workshop on Radiation Imaging Detectors (IWORID). \n\nI initiated the Eureka project \u201cHigh- Resolution Large Area X-ray Detectors (RELAXD, see www.eurekanetwork.org/project/-/id/3624)\u201d, and joined the EU-Catrene project (www.Hidralon.eu) for improvement of CMOS imagers for the Automotive, Medical, Broadcast, Safety/Security/Machine Vision and professional Digital Still Camera markets.\n\nIn 2009 I went into retirement, but still won the first prize in the Workshop for \"Young Entrepreneurs\" of the Dutch Technology Foundation STW. My business idea \u2013 the development, production and sale of large-area x-ray camera panels \u2013 was acknowledged as the most promising idea (see www.stw.nl/Nieuws/20091203.htm) A spin-off company has been established since then, following my idea's (see: http://www.amscins.com). \n\nAlso during my retirement, I obtained a research grant in the Kenniswerkers Regeling from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, for a project between Nikhef and the chip-design house BRUCO BV in Borne, NL, 2009- 2010. (see: www.bruco.nl/news/news.html).\n\nAfter retirement, I was still active for 3 years as a x-ray detection consultant for the Industry.",
