Invited guest lectures and trainings\n2. Consultancy\n3. Artistic projects\n4. Media presence\n\n1. Invited seminars and guest lectures:\nBefore and after the publication of my bestselling book (In verwarde staat: kritiek op een politiek van normaliteit, 2019, Uitgeverij Lontano), I have been providing invited guest lectures and seminars about stigma, inclusivity, neurodiversity and how to improve policies and daily practices in this regard. I have provided tailored lectures for universities (of applied science), mental health agencies, firstresponders, public health organisations, municipalities, and for many other stakeholders. Following a fruitful experience, I have been frequently invited back.\n\n2. Consultancy:\nI provide consulting services, such as recently in a project in Amsterdam (2022-2023) improving collaboration between health and public security actors, while ensuring that privacy rights are protected and the voices of mental health services recipients are heard.\n\n3. Artistic projects:\nFrom an online educative game to a theatre show, I aim to spread my insights artistically and interactively. After a theatre director was touched by an interview with me in Filosofie Magazine, I co-produced a theatre show together with a professional theatre collective (Stormkamer, 2019-21) in order to deliver my insights and message in a creative and artistic format.\n\n4. Media presence\nFollowing the publication of my impactful book, I\u2019ve been appearing in popular media outlets repeatedly and voicing the neurodivergent voice through opinion pieces and participation in interviews. \n\nFor an overview:\nhttps://karlijnroex.net/Nederlands/In-de-media/mobile/",

But how is it done? #COVID19 shapes not only health, but also science. I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) and the Faculty of Humanities (Media Studies) of the University of Amsterdam. Also, I will be a visiting scholar at the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CSTS), University Leiden.\n\nSo what's this research project about?\n\nInformation is paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO has called for action towards the \u201cinfodemic\u201d: an overabundance of often unreliable information which creates uncertainty and anxiety. Responses from governments and the public are based on access to reliable information from experts. This project proposes to systematically survey the adapting information-seeking and information-spreading behaviours of scientists working on COVID-19 as the pandemic unfolds, in order to deliver actionable insights and make available otherwise-lost data for future study and preparedness. (Project description is from this website: http://covid19-ai.uva.nl/index.php/home/covid-19-and-social-science/). The official project's name is \"Collecting systematic survey data on scientists\u2019 information-seeking and information-spreading behaviour in a time of crisis\". I will design and conduct a survey study amongst COVID-19 researchers.\n\nBy addressing the \"infodemic\" I am happy to address an important issue mentioned in this year's Doomsday Clock Statement of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Accessible reliable information is paramount in a time where misinformation is easily spreading and where it is feeding dangerous approaches and conflicts.",

Do marketization and economic shocks also have population-wide effects by fostering anomie in societies? This dissertation project studies the impact of economic change and marketization on suicide as well as its potential moderators and mechanisms. The effects are examined across multiple industrialized countries and regions spanning several decades.
