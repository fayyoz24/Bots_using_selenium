The ODD presence of the developed test cases in simulation was compared against the performance assessment results of the test cases. The performance assessment of the lane-keeping system was done by developing an ODD assessment metric on MATLAB and integrating it with Simcentre Prescan using Simulink. The entire approach used in the thesis was converted into a conceptual framework that can be applied for testing the ODD of the lane-keeping system or any other ADAS feature in the same or different simulation environment. The findings can also be used by vehicle manufacturers, policymakers and road authorities for refining the infrastructure and vehicle for safer autonomous driving. The ODD assessment tool itself is beneficial for Siemens and vehicle manufacturers to test the ODD of already developed test cases in Prescan.",

The research included an in-depth case study on shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) in collaboration with The Future Mobility Network. It involved a multi-actor, multi-criteria decision analysis (MAMCDA) of multiple scenarios to understand the effect of onboard stewards on the cost factors for different stakeholders. This was done with the help of interviews and was really insightful for the operators and the company regarding the different possibilities of implementing SAVs, and the pros and cons associated with them. The different scenarios were created based on factors for SAVs without steward on-board; for example how it would manage in case of emergencies without steward on board and to make a cost-based model. Along with this, I was talking to stewards from different pilots in The Netherlands and abroad to gain more insights to create the scenarios. The final objective was to understand what are the factors that affect the business model with and without stewards.",

The freight data from the years 2013 to 2018 was provided, and that data was used to form a simple regression model to estimate the demand for the year 2020. The incoming, outgoing and domestic good was modelled separately and compared to the result from modelling the total and it was almost similar. \n\nAs for the travel for work demand modelling, the employment data from the year 2003 to 2018 was provided. To make it consistent with the freight data, the data from 2013 to 2018 was only taken. Then the total employed workforce from 2013 to 2018 was taken and used to model the demand for 2020. The job type and the level of education proved to be a valid factor to split the workforce into work from home and non work from home, which was helpful to estimate the future travel demand for work. \n\nAdditionally, from the CBS website, it was found that 39 percent of the overall workforce in the Netherlands worked from home (usually or incidentally). This value coincides with the percentage of the workforce that can work from home which was obtained from the level of education sorting (of 39.3 percent).",
