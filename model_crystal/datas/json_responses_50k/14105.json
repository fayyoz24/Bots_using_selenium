The challenge is to make existing algorithms more reliable and ethical, by investing in, among other things, good data use, increasing transparency, reducing bias and creating a clear picture of the effectiveness and embedding in a broader application process.\n\nThe existing ethical guidelines for reliable AI must be translated into best practices and concrete tools. Local governments can apply these when using AI methods, but software companies can also use them in the further development of AI methods.\n\nThe project mainly works on innovations around Trustworthy AI. Attention is paid to both theory (in the form of guidelines and criteria) and practice (concrete cases from governments and the development of practical tools).",

Such as when formulating the vacancy text, in which requirements are set for a candidate, while other skills and competences are required in the workplace. In addition, it remains difficult to define an objective measure that an employer can use to rank and select candidates, which may also lead to employment discrimination. More prominent use of competencies and skills helps to increase the number of successful matches in the employee recruitment process.\n \nIn order to increase the number of successful matches and thus reduce the number of job seekers, it is essential to develop a dynamic approach to this, focusing on the skills required of employees to fulfill a job. AI plays a crucial role in this by using AI to better match CVs and vacancies in a transparent manner and with as little prejudice as possible (also referred to as bias). Moreover, this approach allows for better monitoring of changes and developments in the labor market in the areas of training, skills and professions.\n\nVarious AI innovations are used within the project, such as Hybrid AI, Responsible AI and skills ontology.",
