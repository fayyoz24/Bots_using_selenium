    "summary": "Hi, my name is Jan Erik Louwsma. \n\nI currently work as Data Scout at sc Heerenveen, a football team in the Netherlands. \n\nI am a graduate in European Studies at NHL Stenden University in Leeuwarden (the Netherlands) and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in North American Studies at Complutense University in Madrid (Spain). I expect to graduate during the fall of 2022. \n\nI am passionate about football and I thoroughly enjoy contributing to the strategic process of player recruitment by delivering analyses through data and videos. Outside of football, I have also developed a strong interest in transatlantic relations, global affairs and political processes through my studies. \n\nIn my spare time, I love to watch football, I go to the gym regularly and I also like to read books.",
