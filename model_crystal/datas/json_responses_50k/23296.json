    "summary": "I am currently studying Archaeology at Leiden University, one of the highest ranking universities in this field. I spent 6 years of her childhood in Australia, and as a result I am fully bilingual in English and Dutch. In February 2019 I started a business called AF Wordsmith, which provides translating and editing services for all text types and purposes. I translate English-Dutch and Dutch-English, and edit both Dutch and English, from small folders to full-length novels, including professional and academic texts. I am a skilled and experienced worker, and produce good results efficiently. I greatly enjoy working with language and writing, and have thus brought it into as many areas of her life as possible, both professionally and in education. \n\nHer work includes: \n- Editing of Smart and Sustainable Built Environments https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-37635-2 \n- Translating of prof. Robert Roggema's inaugural speech at Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, from Dutch to English \n- Proofreading of Uehara et al. (2020): \"Effectiveness of sublation (aufheben) - based swarm planning process in the 2011 Japan disaster area: Creating new planning directions combining polarized opinions\", international journal GEOMATE - Translating Dutch-English of ACTME project in service of Fe-male value.",
