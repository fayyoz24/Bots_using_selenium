    "summary": "I am an enthusiastic, organised and hardworking person who is interested in natural resource management, dynamics and functioning of natural ecosystems, sustainability and renewable energy. More specifically, my research interest focuses on the effect of climate change and other disturbances (e.g. drought and wildfires) on natural ecosystems, and the role of landscape characteristics (e.g. vegetation patterns and refugia) as ecological indicators for the vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems to environmental change. \n\nI currently work as a PhD candidate at Wageningen University & Research, where I research the effect of climate change on peatland vegetation patterns, carbon sequestration and fire risk.",
