    "summary": "Kyaw is a water and climate researcher with expertise in nature-based solutions, climate adaptation, and mitigation. From the Engineering School, he is interested in environmental engineering which it can be related to social and environmental impacts. Therefore, he decided to pursue hydrology, remote sensing and GIS and programming through self-learning. \n\nHis early experience were resided in communication which he is keen to share the scientific insights related to climate change thereby creating a common langauge for the public. He had published investigative articles and cartoon strips to inform local community and policy makers regarding the topics of saltwater intrusion, aquaculture, flood risk control and rainwater harvesting techniques, in Myanmar and, in Mekong region. \n\nAs his dedication, he has been working on the application of remote sensing and GIS for assessing and monitoring the effectiveness of nature-based solutions. To see the synergy of the integration of programming (Python, JavaScript) and remote sensing is a main inspiration for his future career. Recently based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.",
