    "summary": "My name is Steven de Wit 23-06-1999.\nI am a European professional with a bachelor's degree in European Studies from The Hague University of Applied Sciences who has been all over the world in search of new skills/experiences/connections and knowledge.\nI lived for one year in Argentina with a host family in order to have a gap year after receiving my high school diploma. Through this intercultural high school exchange, I was able to learn a new language, and culture and grow as a person. With my obtained Spanish knowledge, I was able to attend the highest level of Spanish language classes at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe study that I followed was called European Studies which focuses on the Political, Cultural and economic perspective of Europe as an entity. During my time as a student here I have been class representative twice because I wanted to communicate with the university and help improve the university where possible in order to make it a better place for students and staff. During big projects, I always aimed to be and was a predominately leading factor in the successful execution of these projects.\nThis is where I believe a few of my strengths such as leadership, communication, team player and problem-solution surface properly.\n\nEuropean Studies is an international-oriented study which allowed me to gain more international experiences such as a one-semester exchange at The Metropolitan University Prague where I finished my six courses with an average of a 9.3. During my living and working in Europe assignment, I went to Valencia to improve my Spanish even further.\n\nMy work experiences at Bites and Stories as a tour guide, alongside my internship at YFU Netherlands, were fantastic experiences which allowed me to even further improve my communication skills, time management skills and general work experience with a great team.\n \nI aspire to start a master's studies and explore the world. The location and topic are currently unknown however, I know that I will always follow my passions and thus find what I am looking for.\n''The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing'' (Walt Disney)",
