The ICT department of the hospital had been developed more than ever in the last few years with an increasing number of ICT employees and a new process for efficient workflow management between the ICT department and the core business. Because of this professionalization, they developed a new process to implement projects more quickly than in the past.  \nThe IT advisory board assigned to Dennis the task of communicating to the ICT employees and managers about the core business, new processes and innovative plans for the next five years.  \nAfter approval of the presented communication plan he carried out the task by organizing large meetings and releasing the strategic ICT plan to the core business. This plan was converted into a book and published in the organization. \nIn addition to this, all managers received a folder with fact sheets regarding the latest ICT developments. Each fact sheet contained an ICT subject that should concern all the readers.  In the future the folder was to be completed with more factsheets in order to keep interested parties informed. This new communication resource guaranteed more centralization of direct communications within the business.  \nBy introducing new communications, the organization was kept informed in a professional manner.  The main result of this project was to raise consciousness of how essential ICT is in Health nowadays.\nKeywords: Prince2, Marketing, Editing project approach, Organization development, Editing communication plan",
