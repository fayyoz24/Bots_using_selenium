Impact of technology in this paper is interpreted as IT values created or achieved from equivalent and contingent interaction between human (people) and non-human agents (technology, organization). Researchers and theorists propose to include a sociomaterial perspective and to develop general and broader, empirical based patterns across different contexts. Based on a literature review containing publications of theoretical considerations and empirical research this paper introduces a first general and sociomaterial based overview and taxonomy of IT values and their relations. IT values have a techno-economic or socio-techno orientation, are dynamically entangled and competitive, and complementary or overlapping. IT values are related to time, sponsor and, hierarchy. The identified IT values are ordered into a framework which has to be treated as a starting point to discuss further the definition, dynamics and relations of IT values from a sociomaterial perspective.\r\n",
