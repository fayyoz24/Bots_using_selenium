I started by marketing the 'soon to be established' team among students in Maastricht by distributing flyers and posters that were sponsored by local print shops, and by organizing an information meeting in a venue that was made available free of charge by Maastricht University. This way, I managed to recruit an amazing group of volunteers who were eager to start promoting and supporting UNICEF and their important work. Since then, the UNICEF Student Team organized several successful fundraising events and events to educate people (specifically students) about UNICEF and its goals and projects. \n\nAs president of the team I coordinated our events, was responsible for the communication with UNICEF Netherlands and chaired the periodical team meetings. I am proud that my efforts resulted in a team that is nowadays still a very successful and active part of student life in Maastricht and of the UNICEF student network in the Netherlands.",
