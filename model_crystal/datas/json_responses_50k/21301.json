    "summary": "Do you want to know how I gave up sommeliership and made myself an Android developer? Here's my story...\n\nHaving studied English linguistics out of interest in languages, I built a beautiful career as a teacher in Russia. I particularly enjoyed the logic of the language and the challenge of building efficient lessons.\n\nOnly when I moved to the Netherlands did I realize that I was going with a flow and there might be something more fulfilling for me. I tried a couple of different things, one of them was a sommelier certificate and practice working in bars. But that wasn't it. I understood what I really am inspired about is tech and innovation. So, I tried an iOS development course which made me realize that coding and developing are challenging, interesting and bring me joy. That was the moment when I made the first conscious decision about my future.\n\nWith no idea of Android OS and dramatically little coding experience I started to work as an Android developer in KLM via Calco (traineeship for high professionals). I am proud and excited about how much I grew in that year at KLM. I learnt not only coding in a new language (big Kotlin enthusiast now), several common libraries, code review, testing and other developer skills, but also teamwork, agility and corporate culture. There is incredibly much more for me to learn, but I am happy doing that and knowing that I have made the right decision.\n\nHaving some production experience in developing products for global company, my can-do mentality,  willingness to learn and passion to move users to a new digital future I am enthusiastic about finding new opportunities.\n",

The first two months of the traineeship consist of an educational program at Calco\u2019s headquarters in Amsterdam. During this period I am gaining knowledge about different functions and processes in IT and I am following a specialisation course that matches my interests and skills (e.g. information analyst, programmer, tester or junior project manager). In addition, an important part of the traineeship focuses on the development of soft skills, such as presentation and communication skills.\nAfter the educational program has been completed, I will be working for one of our clients for a period of 22 months. Whilst working there I will further develop my skills on the job. A field manager from Calco will coach and supervise me during this period, and together we will create a personal development plan in order to continue my personal development.",
