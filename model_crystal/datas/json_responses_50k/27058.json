Most recent, I\u2019ve been included into the A350 project, where I\u2019ve had a lot 3d design and investigation work. For this project I was responsible for the design of the roof access and level. Especially the projector setup, frames and cladding was a nice challenge. This enabled me to prove myself to the team and to have a better understanding of the software and the engineering processes in place. After the news of the sale to CAE the whole hardware engineering team was invited to Montreal, Canada to spend 4 weeks in their factory and to learn their methods, procedures and software. This was a very learn full experience for me. The last two years have been a very learn full experience for me and I feel I have grown a lot in this function. I have good results and present myself as a team player who will take the efforts and responsibility\u2019s where needed.

After a couple of months I started working on the linings for the Boeing 737-800NG. The interior of the cockpit existed out of dozens of vacuum molded ABS parts. These parts had to be cut to size and trimmed nicely, on a high level of quality. Each project took between 850 to 1600 hours to complete  There was no process yet, so I had to create instructions and processes that enabled others to build the simulators. This also meant that I had to design a lot of components which were needed to complete the cockpit structure. The processes and instructions also took a close eye on the quality of the work, something I have always valued as a very high standard and importance. In order to keep that quality high, we\u2019ve often decided with other approaches than usual. A good example of that would be the introduction of upholstered parts, which I made in-house. \nAs the company grew we started to build other types of simulators as well. This meant that the workforce grew and I started to work with a team to build the interiors. The team (that at the highest point existed out of 7 people) had to be learned how we build our simulators and to what quality we do that. Another result of the growth was that I had to keep track, create and report the planning of our builds, prepare the parts for installation, to have contact with suppliers and so on. I was faced with a lot of challenges thru out the years, for example the interior for a fixed base Airbus A320. Since original part weren\u2019t available I had to design and manufacture the interior from sheets of plastic. At the same time I also needed to keep an eye on the progress of the other projects. Also the resent Boeing 767 full flight and fixed base has a lot of linings designed by me, I had to work with pixelated pictures that were made in America to create the custom cockpit interior, a one off for our customer FedEx.",
