    "summary": "My StrengthsFinder Top 5:\n1) Achiever\n2) Analytical\n3) Individualization\n4) Input\n5) Learner \n\nGrowing up in the information age, I have been surrounded by technology my whole life.  Throughout the years I have seen the impact of technological inventions in the expansion of socialization, innovative ways of thinking and advanced modes of learning.  As someone who embraces the rapid developing changes of our era, I have always been interested in technology and its capability to positively change and connect the world.\n \nIn order to expand my knowledge on the constantly changing technological world, I chose to study Management Information Systems for my undergraduate degree.  But this is only the first step. I am aware that the Information Technology industry is an ever changing field as what I learn now could become obsolete in three years. Therefore, I pride myself on being an eternal learner who is passionate about the growing and upcoming technological advances. \n \nThroughout my years of learning Information Systems, I have refined my intrinsic skills of problem-solving, being analytical and organized. With these skills, I have loved taking the initiative to tackle new challenges and look forward to even more in the technological field. Technology has inspired me to become an out-of-the-box thinker while also considering the importance of minute details. I am confident in my ability to learn, to expand and ultimately change the technological future.\n\nFor the first 5 and a half years of my career, I worked as a Business Systems Analyst with an emphasis of Data Analytics in Supply Chain.  Hunter Industries provided me the delicate balance of the challenge to learn, as well as the reward of directly applying and sharing that new knowledge with colleagues. During my time here I realized I wanted to further my education and pursue my Masters in Business Administration in Rotterdam School of Management.",
