    "summary": "I am a master's student in Automotive Technology at Eindhoven University of Technology. Throughout my studies, I have focused on modeling and control of dynamical systems with an application in the automotive domain. My primary research interest lies in the field of Vehicle dynamics and control.\n\nI have an extensive experience in tire testing and analysis. In my previous collaboration with a tire manufacturer, I worked on developing an optical measurement setup to measure tire belt deflection. As a tire tester, I regularly work with the Tire team at Siemens Industrial Digital Software to carry out tire measurements for their clients. I have experience in developing tire models for application in handling and stability analysis of vehicles, with a thorough understanding of tire mechanics and tire-road friction characteristics. I also have experience in developing vehicle and tire prototype models for time-domain and steady-state simulation in Matlab. I am passionate about developing innovative tools and solutions for the automotive industry that positively impact society.",

These objectives are achieved by distributing the torque on the four wheels and steering the live axle by the correct amount. The proposed controller also considers the dynamics of the tire and accounts for the combined slip that takes place. The unified control is developed by using a linear model predictive control approach. Appropriate barrier functions are used to limit the values of the control parameters in the optimum region. Simulation results have shown that the controller can effectively address various handling and stability issues in a variety of scenarios.",

This can either be done by trial and error or by using optimization tools such as Jaya Algorithm, The benefit is global optimum setup with fewer iterations. The model used for the objective function is verified with MSC Adams. The model was robust and correlated closely to the multibody model from MSC Adams. Subsequently multiple objectives were introduced for the optimization problem. The results from the optimization were again checked against multibody model which showed that the desired characteristics were achieved.",
