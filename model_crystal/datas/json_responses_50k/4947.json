    "summary": "Dr. Ataol is an urban planner & designer & researcher specialized in participatory urban research and collaborative urban planning with children. Her research analyses how cities can benefit from participatory approaches for better inclusive and just development & management. Her experience includes collaborations with non-professional groups as well as professional groups, such as local governments, NGOs, and foundations within the fields of evidence-driven policymaking and participatory urban planning & management towards creating inclusive and sustainable cities for all. \n\nShe holds a Ph.D. in Urbanism and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Maastricht University. Additionally, she shares the editorship of Media+Book Review at Children, Youth and Environments journal. \n\nAs an urban researcher, Dr. Ataol dedicates her research to empowering children in urban planning since children are a distinctive user group of urban environments, as well as because the built environment is a significant indicator of children's physical and mental development starting from birth. Above all, because children are citizens of today and adults of tomorrow, their well-being in urban environments is a matter of nations' future. Therefore, she advocates for children's right to participate in every matter children think matters, including their cities, and believes in inclusive development for urban environments. Additionally, she has a special interest in the role of mediators, who can be researchers, architects, or urban planners, in enabling participatory processes for children in the domain of urban planning and design. \n\nDr. Ataol is committed to achieving international goals and agendas, such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and New Urban Agenda (NUA), with children as urban citizens. Specifically, her scholarship contributes knowledge towards the implementation of  SDG#11 \u2013enhance inclusive urbanization and provide access to safe, inclusive, and accessible public spaces for all and NUA's vision of cities for all, promoting inclusivity, equal use, and accessibility.",

It aims to investigate the perceptions children have of sustainable / unsustainable consumption behaviour and their approach to utilising circularity in their activities targeting their unsustainable consumption behaviour. The ultimate goal is to both change children\u2019s attitude and behaviour towards sustainable development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and to promote and empower children to become active and responsible urban citizens. The method that will be used is interactive workshops with children aimed at three purposes: exchanging ideas on views among children about pluriform societies; discussing ideas that exist among children about sustainable / unsustainable consumption behaviour; and making plans about community action involving children, parents and schools.",

Through the competition, the consortium will collect submissions providing creative and novel ideas for circular city approaches. The challenge invites young people to submit their own ideas for a sustainable future in their own environment while at the same time educating them in the topic of sustainable development. This approach will have a threefold effect: (i) in researching a competition-based approach of educating functional urban design in support of circular systems and the use of nature-based solutions and design curricula for different school types and age groups, the project will improve education in schools and education for sustainable development in particular; (ii) in providing students the possibility to submit ideas on a new approach on circularity, the project will raise awareness on sustainability; and (iii) in providing fresh ideas and approaches, cities will be enabled improve their resource use and waste management strategies, business models and smart city developments for the common good. Cities will further be enabled to build adaptable future visions and adopting a circular economy strategy.",

By doing so, this project expands global knowledge on the criticality of children's capabilities, the role of parents, and the role of urban researchers within participatory urban planning research. With a case study in Istanbul, this thesis also provides a possible roadmap towards a comprehensive rethinking of Istanbul from a child-focused point of view through participatory urban planning.",
