    "summary": "I am an aggressively mediocre guitar player with a passion for writing equally mediocre songs. For myself, it is not about how well I can perfect my play. It's about having an outlet for my creativity and love of writing. In February of 2020, I continued to channel that passion into a travel blog highlighting the weird, beautiful and unique things I have experienced throughout my adventures abroad. I believe experience is most beautiful when shared, and that's why I chose to enter the field of Public Relations. Experience shapes who we are, how we think and our actions in everyday life. In my experience, a  brand that understands the value that people place on unique engagements and is able to execute it creatively will always make a strong impression on their publics.",
