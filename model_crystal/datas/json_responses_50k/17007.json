At the end of this project we run a workshop, we published a book, and hold a photo exhibition. In the \"Jostar\" project, three teams were collaborating, the first team was responsible for observation and interviews with people. The second team tried to collect information from the institutes. And the third team, my team, was responsible for categorizing and present the information,  then interviewing with other professors and specialists, at the end identifying criterion/standards, and publishing the results.",
