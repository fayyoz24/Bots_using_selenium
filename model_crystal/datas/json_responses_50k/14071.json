His efforts and achievements, as well as his strive for excellence and impact\nin academic research and education, are reflected in this Award.\n\nIn 2017, the Jury consisting of Prof. dr. Cees van Riel, Prof. dr. Joep Cornelissen, Prof. dr. Pursey Heugens,\nDr. Guido Berens and Marijke Baumann MSc, awarded the Cees van Riel Award for lmpact & Excellence in Corporate Communication 2017 for my Master's Thesis 'Visions and Reflections: How CEOs and their executive leadership team play an increasingly important role in driving strategic communication'. As argued by the Jury, \"the thesis combines the highest level of academic rigour with practical relevance and a practically important question,\" and \"thus meets the double hurdle of both academic rigour and practical relevance that is the hallmark of this Award.\"",
