    "summary": "I'm a food designer working with cheese. My background is in fine arts and design, product and interior design. Thirteen years ago, I discovered I could make cheese at home and fell in love with cheese making. Today I run De Kaasserie, a platform meant to promote and explore the craft of making cheese. At De Kaasserie workshops are offered and artisanal cheese making tools are made available for people to explore the history of cheese making and to experiment with the cheese that can make today. Creative cheese making is about this exploration, creating a complete experience around cheese making, which is meant to inspire and empower.",
