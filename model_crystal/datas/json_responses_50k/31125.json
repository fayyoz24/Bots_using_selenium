Once that was under control, I also managed several projects. Responsibilities included:\n* setting up a new team of initially seven team members, later downsized to four. This included defining roles, creating job descriptions, hiring and training of new staff\n* setting up complex rules for pay and bill rates in the CRM system in line with client contracts, to ensure * accurate weekly pay to 3,000 temporary employees and 1,000 weekly client invoices\n* credit management: reduced overdue receivables fromr $6m to $2m in my first eight months\n* set up automated weekly margin reporting by branch and customer, which significantly reduced the need for ad hoc reporting. \n* budgets and forecasting: I developed a new financial model to simplify calculations and improve input from operations which was praised by business managers\n* support RFPs and contract negotiations by building financial and commercial models with margin analysis and target pricing \n* project manager on new accounting system implementation (Navision 2018) in group companies Absolute IT and AWF. Both were delivered on time and within budget\n* integration of financial systems and processes after acquisition of Select Recruitment",
