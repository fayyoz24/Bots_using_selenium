    "summary": "Five years of study and work experience as a sales assistant for a Japanese company targeting the European market have strongly confirmed an internationally-oriented job as the preferred career choice for me. I strive for an entry-level position in international company or organization to deploy the various cultural, social, organizational and communication skills that I have developed through my varied work experiences: in sales, retail, hospitality work, teaching, health and child care and internship in Japan.\n\nI am an enthusiastic and committed graduate of Japanese studies who has experience in working in a professional Japanese institution and is keen to enter a career focused on my passion for Japanese society, presenting opportunities to work with similar minded people. \n\nBeing passionate about helping people and improving my language and communicative skills, I am an active member in several Japan-related organisations in the Netherlands: NJV (Dutch-Japanese Association), Kazaguruma (Japanese Women's Club in The Hague), Nichiran Silvernet Foundation (health care organization for aged Japanese living in the Netherlands) and the Alumnikai of Leiden (association for Japanese studies graduates) to stay in contact with people interested in Japan, practice my Japanese and provide help for Japanese living in the Netherlands. \n\nI regularly take part in the activities held in these organisations and have numerous responsibilities. For example, because of my language proficiency in Japanese, English and Dutch language and academic background, I am often involved in helping provide information on the Dutch working and education system for members by translating Dutch documents to Japanese or English. \n",
