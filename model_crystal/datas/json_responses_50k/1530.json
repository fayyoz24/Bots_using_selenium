They are challenged by emerging powers, such as China and other BRICS countries, which have different views on global order. The Russian war against Ukraine has further undermined international cooperation and caused gridlock across global governance. Nationalist populism, and particularly the Trump administration in the United States, have put the fragility of multilateralism on display.\n\nThis contestation of global governance is particularly concerning for Europe. The European Union (EU), which is an international organization itself, and its member states have long been key supporters of multilateralism and a system of global governance that is rules-based, effective, legitimate and democratic. What is more, many of the global challenges we are currently facing \u2013 climate change, pandemics, migration, inequalities and digitalisation \u2013 can only be tackled through cooperation.\n\nThe research project ENSURED examines how the EU and its members can transform and defend global governance to make it more robust, effective and democratic. This ENSURED project is coordinated by Maastricht University and includes 14 universities, think tanks and a civil society partner from Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands as well as Brazil, China, India, South Africa and the United States. ENSURED is funded for three years through the EU Horizon research programme.",

This research project analyses the capabilities which these policemen, rule of law experts and monitors need to properly carry out their functions. These capabilities range from armoured vehicles, to training and communcation systems. In addition to carrying out research, the project also has a strong dissemination component to help EU officials in improving civilian capabilities.\n\nThis large-scale project, funded under Horizon 2020 Secure Societies, is coordinated by the University of Bristol and contains ten universities, think tanks and EU agencies from across Europe. Researchers at Maastricht University focus on the EU civilian capabilities needed to respond to crises in comparison to other international organisations such as the UN and OSCE. They also analyse interactions between the EU, UN and OSCE in terms of civilian capabilities.",

These secretariats play a vital role in the success or failure of military operations.\n\nThis project investigated why sovereign states delegate such important functions to international secretariats in international security.
