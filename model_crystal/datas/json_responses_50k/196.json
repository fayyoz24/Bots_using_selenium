    "summary": "We are the medium.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Just like fire, I am passionate about the world in its numerous multifaceted expressions, experiences and understandings. Creativity and motivation run in my blood.\n\n\ud83d\udca8 Just like air, I am open-minded, flexible, and a great connector. I breathe in intellectual challenges, and I breathe out fresh thoughts and ideas. \n\n\ud83c\udf0a Just like water, I am highly adaptable. I take the form that I am given, yet my inner values and pursuits stay the same. I love exploring \u201copen waters\u201d, and I flow with ease and calmness through everything I\u2019m doing.\n\n\ud83c\udf33 Just like earth, I am grounded and stable; responsible and down-to-earth. I remember our roots, and I feel connected to our shared home, the Earth.\n\nIn my 17 years of experience in the creative industry, I have:\n\n* received awards in competitions and festivals in Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, the Canary Islands, USA, Serbia, Moldova, Belarus, Poland, Portugal and England.\n* played in the Russian series \"Vangelia\", the National Theater of Bulgaria, and in the professional Art Theatre of Sofia. \n* sung in the National Opera and Ballet of Sofia: I was given a lead role (Feodor, son of Boris Godunov) in the opera \"Boris Godunov\" by Modest Mussorgsky, the lead role as a musical theatre actor in the musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d and a role in the opera \"Borislav\" by Maestro Georgi Atanasov.\n* participated in many TV commercials (e.g. a global commercial for Coca Cola with over 30.000.000 views).\n* been a member of the Junior Jury of Bulgaria for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2016. \n* been a semi-finalist in the popular Serbian TV format for singers \"Pinkove zvezdice\" (2018) after 12 successful rounds. \n* published four original songs - \"Sabana\", \"Roses Die Too\", \u201cFool 4 You\u201d and \u201cColliding Stars\u201d, with which I have won major awards at competitions in Portugal, the Canary Islands and Italy. \n* published an esoteric book called \u201cAs above, so below\u201d in Bulgarian.\n\n\ud83d\udcda I am currently in my third year of studies towards a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Media & Culture at the University of Amsterdam, and recently graduated a Minor in Communication Science. I love learning, and I often sign up for additional courses (e.g. business, esotericism and quantum physics).\n\n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f The horizon of my passions is constantly expanding, yet my personal goals stay the same: to reveal my creative, academic and professional potential in the creative industry; to inspire and to be inspired; to spread love and awareness, and to create new positive experiences for myself and for the others.",
