    "summary": "Mara Lin Visser is a freelance visual anthropologist and filmmaker based in Amsterdam. All through her BA in Media & Culture, she was interested in different forms of media and its ability to affect people by making them think, feel, question or act. Film as a medium gives Mara Lin the freedom to express her thoughts about certain topics and academic observations in a natural way. The camera is a strong tool to explore and conduct research. For her MA in Visual Anthropology, Mara Lin went to Ghana for her fieldwork. Her research resulted in the film Unity: Dress-scapes of Accra (2016), which has been screened at several film festivals (RAI, Ethnofest and won Best Student Award at SVA).\n\tAt the moment Mara Lin is a visitor research at Getp-GRAFO (Research Group of the Cross-cultural Study of Kinship) at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona doing research on queer communities; she is an instructor at afilm, International Film Workshops, teaching Film History & Media Studies and she is part of the collective ethnovision, which aims to bridge the knowledge-gap between the academics and a bigger audience using the power of audiovisual research methods. Also, she is exploring the field of participatory methods, ethnofiction and artistic research practices because she thinks this could uncover social structures in an interesting way. For Mara Lin, the most interesting. part of filmmaking is connecting with\u00a0people; making them feel comfortable by spending time without a camera, enhancing the protagonist\u2019s freedom to tell their own stories in their own way. She is interested in (in)equality, queer culture, participation society, material culture, geopolitics, ecology and art. She speaks Dutch, English and is learning Spanish.",

The comeback of African print seems to be emerging in the fashion system of Accra.

In this research, I explore the gender diversity within the Barcelona Roller Derby community through performance, dress, movement and the body. Through participant observation, interviews and visual methods like re-enactment and photo elicitation, I identify that the \u201croller girls\u201d perform an alternative gender identity, which is encouraged by the community through the construction of a \u2018derby identity\u2019 and a training program called \u2018fresh meat\u2019. Although this work is mainly focused on gender expression, it will also assess how the community\u2019s diversity in broader terms (race, ability, class) are prioritized and realized.\n\nThe content is based on the visual ethnographic research focused on Gender, The body and Community within Barcelona Roller Derby which I am conducting since March. I applied visual methods such as photo-elicitation interviews and reenactment to uncover embodied and \u2018self-evident\u2019 knowledge. \n    My visual observations of 'bout' (match), training and event and the roller girls\u2019 knowledge from the base of this visual essay. It shows moving and interacting bodies and explores gender performance, body diversity and self-confidence within and outside of the strong, self-organized community of Roller Derby.\n    Next to this base of research findings, there are other \u2018thought-lines\u2019 unfolding, which reflects on theory, the process of conducting research, analyzing visual data and distribution of images. Quotes of other researchers strengthen my observations. Images of the crew and me filming & interviewing and social media posts of the research participants, reflect on our influence on the situation.
