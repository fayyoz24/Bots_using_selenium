    "summary": "As a creator and painter, I have come to realize that life is an ever-evolving canvas, waiting for us to pick up the brush and paint our own destiny. Through my personal journey, I have learned one crucial lesson: change is possible at any point, but it is not always an easy path. It requires resilience, determination, and the willingness to try, even if success doesn't come on the first attempt. In my own life, I discovered that my most significant changes were often successful on the second take.\n\nOne thing that has always fueled my spirit is the desire to experience new things and travel. I have been fortunate enough to call Poland, Germany, France, and the Netherlands my home, immersing myself in different cultures and gaining a profound appreciation for the beauty of diversity.\n\nMy educational background in International Economics and Business Administration from the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany, equipped me with a solid foundation in the corporate world. However, a year in France studying the language, delving into the local customs, and connecting with the vibrant French culture ignited a deep sense of curiosity within me. It was during this time that I began to question my path and realize that something was missing from the business-oriented world I had known.\n\nReturning to \"real\" life, I pursued various roles as a project manager and trainer, hoping to find my tribe and fulfill that void. Yet, despite my accomplishments, I couldn't shake the feeling that my true calling lay elsewhere. Finally, I summoned the courage to follow my heart and enrolled in an art academy. It was a leap of faith, stepping into the unknown, but one that brought immense fulfillment and purpose to my life.\n\nDuring this transformative period, I also embraced the opportunity to work as a freelance communication trainer, language teacher, and translator. This allowed me to explore my passion for languages, connect with people from diverse backgrounds, and hone my skills in communication and cultural understanding.\n\nNow, as a technical advisor at Talens, I find myself in a position where all my different paths converge. I have the privilege of utilizing my unique blend of skills, languages, and art inspiration to make a meaningful impact. \n\nIn addition to my work, I have also established my own studio, where I pour my heart and soul into creating art that reflects my journey and perspective. Exhibiting my work internationally allows me to share my story with the world, connecting with art enthusiasts who resonate with the emotions and experiences captured on my canvases.",
