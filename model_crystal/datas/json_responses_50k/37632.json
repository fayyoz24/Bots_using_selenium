    "summary": "I enjoy creating eye-opening learning experiences that inspire people to reflect, learn and connect with each other. With 5+ years of experience, I have designed and delivered over 50 online, offline and blended trainings, workshops and learning trajectories for diverse audiences all across the world. \n\nMy colleagues often describe me as empathetic, creative, curious and pragmatic. These qualities allow me to truly understand people's challenges, design learning experiences that are both engaging and relevant, and continuously learn myself. \n\nI am committed to making this world a more inclusive and just place and want to use my learning design skills to do just that. I am keen to continue working on topics that matter to me including (digital) inclusion and equality, human rights, climate change, and youth engagement. I am excited for whatever's up next!",
