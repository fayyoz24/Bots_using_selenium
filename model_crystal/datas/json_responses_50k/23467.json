The project investigates common and unique genetic and environmental risk factors for these disorders using Lifelines, a databank and biobank of over 167,000 participants from the Netherlands. I use skills in advanced population-based analysis techniques, e.g., longitudinal, factor, network, and latent transition analyses, and statistical learning to study the data. This project combines knowledge and methods from molecular genetics, epidemiology, and psychiatry to investigate causal mechanisms of internalizing and functional disorders. This project is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.",
