The aim of the PhD is to analyse the technical and financial aspects of the Ocean Grazer; on the technical side the influence of the parameter settings of the floaters in the Wave Energy Converter array on its power production efficiency is analysed, while on the financial side a systems engineering approach is taken to create an overview of requirements, risks and costs.\n\nWho wouldn't want to contribute to a more sustainable future?",

Through programming in VBA an Excel-based tool was created to choose and arrange specific jobs at different machines. Furthermore, this tool assists in forwarding the necessary information about each job to the operators and aids the communication and collaboration across the company's organigram.\nIt can be considered a first step towards a more complex, detailed and tailored planning and scheduling tool that will be able to optimise resource allocation and production efficiency.",

The first week of the programme I visited as many projects as possible to choose on which to focus for the following weeks. We were allowed to organize our weekly - morning and afternoon -\n activities individually. I decided to put my time and effort into three projects:\n- visiting an Elderly Home to offer the women and men time to share their experiences and let their creativity out through art and crafts projects\n- teaching English to girls in the Girls Home. By organizing craft projects, we worked with girls between the age of 12 and 18 years trying to teach them English in a more casual environment\n- teaching English and assisting a differently-abled class in the Girls Elementary School. The project was very structured as the girls needed a routine. We assisted the class teacher in the assignments and had a 2-hour timeslot in which we gave an English lesson; this project also included a weekly swimming lesson.\n\nhttp://www.volunteersrilanka.net/"
