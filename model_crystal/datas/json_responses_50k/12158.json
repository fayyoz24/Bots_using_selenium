Participants assume the mantles of national ambassadors, simulating various organs, committees and specialised agencies while seeking to resolve outstanding issues on the international agenda, from human rights to breaches of the peace. \n\nThis aims to build an understanding of global challenges and governance amid youth that crosses borders of culture and nationality. Using the knowledge, the experiences and the relationships they form at LIMUN and through other Model United Nations events, it is hoped that the next generation of world leaders will be equipped to face global issues with the spirit of international cooperation.\n\n\n\nA delegate represent the views of a single Member State of the United Nations, researching that country's policy and advocating their stance to other delegates. In this way, participants familiarise themselves with state policy, ideas and cultures different to their own.\n\nThe debate is controlled by an experienced set of Chairpersons employing thorough rules of procedure. The objective is to reach consensus and pass a statement of the international community's response to a particular area of concern.\n\nMUN encourages the development of skills essential to all fields of study and employment, such as strong leadership, inovative thinking and public speaking, negotiation, mediation and consensus-building, and the ability to rapidly form relationships with people of different backgrounds and cultures.",

Also, I edited, translated and published website content, product descriptions, marketing postings per social media and email. To be able to deliver value, good knowledge of our operating systems, logistics and products is indispensable to offer timely customer orientated output. I work in a small, dynamic and international team of young professionals and students and was therefore able to actively contribute to the development of SB Supply. The main working language is German, but communication around the office takes place in English. Occasionally, Dutch or French tasks are required as well. Since I've been working for SB Supply the longest within our team, I also took care of recruiting new team members, training new employees and coordinating working shifts. In the last year we were able to expand our turnover in Germany, growing in the French markets while keeping a powerful position in the Netherlands, as well as expanding to new distribution channels and marketspaces. We started trading increasingly on Amazon, bol.com, wupti.com for example.",
