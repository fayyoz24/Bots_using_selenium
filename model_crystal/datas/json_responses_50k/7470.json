Furthermore, I also looked into the importance/contribution of fogging systems to the cultivation of licensed cannabis, and what affects the choice of these systems. Therefore, the internship consisted of qualitative desk research, supported by interviews with existing clients of the companies, which helped to gain an understanding of the current market and create a view of the near future of the industry. Adding to that, during my internship I contributed to the organization of a cannabis consortium (CfC) which is the result of a collaboration of many big companies in the Netherlands.",
