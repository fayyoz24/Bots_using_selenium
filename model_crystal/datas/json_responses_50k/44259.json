Some specific cases  were investigated in terms of physical, functional characteristics, problems, solutions and lessons learnt. Based on those findings the potential of using the Dutch knowledge to specific cases abroad was explored.\nThe cases of Markermeer, Ijsselmeer, Volkerak \u2013 Zoommer, Oostvoornsemeer and Haringvliet, Jakarta bay and Senegal were analyzed.\nIt was found that the new delta lakes management approach in the Netherlands has been shifted to a win-win approach. However it is still difficult the implementation of all their aspects. Most of the projects are still under process (for example Sandmotor, Marker Wadden), so there is still a gap between the innovative ideas and their implementation. What is also still lacking, is the shortcutting. Moreover, due to uncertainties resulted from the climate changes and the effects of human activities, a mainly technical approach are not enough. An integrated plan with a long term vision should be created.\nRegarding the potential of sharing the Dutch knowledge abroad, it was found that the Dutch knowledge toolbox could be useful in both cases of Jakarta and Senegal as a long as the local circumstances are taken into account. The research findings prove that the knowledge sharing in Jakarta and Senegal is possible technically, however there are many uncertainties regarding the local governance issues.\nThe lessons learnt from the Dutch cases would be useful for the knowledge toolbox which could be enlarged by adding knowledge also from other countries experiences in delta lakes management. Since delta lakes management requires the combination of both engineering and planning capacity skills, and since the Dutch knowledge sharing abroad is limited mostly by local governance issues, a further research about the delta lake planning and the governance issues which arise in Delta lakes management is recommended.",

            "description": "This study aimed to explore the dynamics between plants and sand trapping during sand transport events. More specifically, it focused on the interaction of plant density, sand deposition and sand transport which gives insight into processes that underlie embryo dune formation and their development over time. The study was performed on Sand motor Zuid-Holland Terheijde from 2 October until 24 October 2014. Two different species, Ammophila arenaria and Elytrigia juncea, of low and high density were separately planted in 12 plots. At the same time sand deposition within and behind the plots as well as sand transport measurements were performed in order to find the plant effect on sand trapping. Results showed that Ammophila arenaria of high density affected the sand trapping, resulting to higher sand deposition within the vegetated plots. Sand deposition was also affected by the different dates during the experiment. The knowledge delivered from our research suggests that high density Ammophila arenaria leads to higher sand trapping within the embryo dunes and could be incorporated in coastal management. More specifically, the introduction of Ammophila arenaria in the Dutch nourished coastal areas could be an efficient management practice for embryo dune formation and development over time, which contributes to coastal defence from the flood risk and beach erosion.",

Next to this, the potential of the recycling of organic waste in urban agriculture in The Hague is analyzed. The research is commissioned by Alterra, Wageningen as part of the FOODMETRES project. The analysis is done with studying relevant literature , conducting interviews and by conducting two case studies of urban agriculture initiatives in detail. Results show that the current situation of organic waste management in The Hague could be improved, through actions of both the municipality and the citizens. With several platforms focused on urban agriculture and many new arising initiatives, urban agriculture receives increasing attention from the public. Also the municipality has an increased attention to urban agriculture. Several innovative initiatives that use organic waste in urban agriculture are described. The current situation of using organic waste in urban agriculture is of small scale, which is the main limitation to it\u2019s potential. But there are several positive externalities that can make the use of organic waste in urban agriculture a contribution to the society.\nAs a project manager of the research team, I specifically developed team coordinating and management skills.",
