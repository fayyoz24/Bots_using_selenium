    "summary": "Selinde van Engelenburg is an assistant professor at the ICT section at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology. Both her teaching and research activities focus on the subject of digitalisation. She has a sociotechnical perspective in which new technological developments, such as blockchain technology and AI, play an important role. She especially likes the challenge of designing systems in highly complex multi-stakeholder environments. She has a special interest in designing information systems to support a circular economy.\n\nPreviously, she was a Postdoc researcher at Delft University of Technology investigating the role of new technological developments in cybersecurity. Her main focus was on the risks and benefits of Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning in particular for cybersecurity.\n\nBefore this, Selinde obtained her PhD at Delft University of Technology in the field of ICT. Her PhD research was on designing context-aware architectures for business-to-government information sharing for enhancing security and safety in international container shipping. The large-scale overarching architecture she developed helps to ensure that information sharing is compliant with laws and regulations. Furthermore, it provides businesses with control over their data, reducing their risks of sharing and improving their willingness to share. The architecture uses distributed ledger technology to provide secure access control. In addition, she developed a new method for designing context-aware systems in complex multi-stakeholder environments.\n\nSelinde obtained a master\u2019s degree in Artificial Intelligence from Utrecht University with a specialisation in logic and intelligent systems.",

The purpose of this project is to develop a heterogeneous multi-agent system that can be used by clinicians and researches in the medical domain to make diagnoses (amongst others). One of my duties in this project was to determine what the requirements for a logical component of this multi-agent system should be by studying literature and consulting experts in the medical domain. In addition, I investigated what logic would meet these requirements, I carried this task out by taking over 80 logics into consideration.  Since no logic could be found that met all requirements, I proceeded with developing one myself, resulting in the temporal argumentation logic defined in my master\u2019s thesis.",

During my internship I worked at designing a prototype of the electronic assistant that was tested at Antarctica in 2012. In addition, I worked at the practical realization of the prototype. I furthermore set up and conducted a laboratory experiment at TNO using the prototype. Amongst my responsibilities was also the scheduling of the project and making sure everything was going as scheduled. I prepared internal meetings at TNO and meetings with the people from ESA. I also participated in these meetings and I gave several presentations about the prototype at them. I was in addition responsible for the communication between the external programmers of the prototype and TNO.",
