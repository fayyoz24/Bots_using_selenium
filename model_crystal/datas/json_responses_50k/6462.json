    "summary": "Every day I get the question: how does impact affect sustainability? Here is my answer.. (in Dutch) https://vumagazine.nl/duurzaamheid-en-commercie-kunnen-elkaar-versterken\n\nWith a background in marketing, sales and entrepreneurship, I care about people. People make you laugh and people make the dream. I'm truly passionated about getting the best out of myself and help people around me to be at their natural best. Trust, empathy and open communication will maximize everyones potential.\n\nBesides, I'm super passionated about rolling out new concepts, strategic decisions, go-to-market strategies and diving into the deep. Next to this, I have a proven track record in sales. \n\nMY CURRENT CHAPTER \ud83d\udcd9\nWith MOYU we are creating never-ending products made out of stone waste. Due to the unique elements of stone paper, every page is erasable and rewritable up to 500 times. Companies\u00a0like Rabobank, Philips, WWF and Triodos Bank use our products in their mission to reduce paper waste, reach sustainability goals, decrease CO2 emission and reduce the costs, without losing on writing experience. Besides, we create on-demand personalized notebooks which make it an effective way of communication for companies; both internal and external. Since we are serious about nature and trying to reduce deforestation, we also plant a tree for every notebook in cooperation with the local community Trees for Kenya. \ud83c\udf34\n\n2019: Started with my partner Roel. \ud83d\ude80\n2020: 8+ rockstars, planted 20.000 trees. \ud83d\udc9a\n2021: 15+ rockstars, planted 45.000 trees. \ud83d\udc9a\n2022: .....\n\nCONTACT\nWant to teach, learn, discuss or connect?
