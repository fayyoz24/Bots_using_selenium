    "summary": "Amir Zjajo (Senior Member IEEE) received the MSc and DIC degrees from the Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2000 and the PhD. degree from Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands in 2010, all in electrical engineering. In 2000, he joined Philips Research Laboratories as a member of the research staff in the Mixed-Signal Circuits and Systems Group. From 2006 until 2009, he was with Corporate Research of NXP Semiconductors as a Senior Research Scientist. In 2009, he joined Delft University of Technology, where he was responsible for leading research into intelligent systems within a range of EU-funded research projects.  In 2018, he co-founded Innatera Nanosystems B.V. to commercialize neuromorphic signal processing technology.\n\nDr. Zjajo has published more than 90 papers in referenced journals and conference proceedings, and holds more than 10 US patents or patent pending. He is author of the books Brain-Machine Interface: Circuits and Systems (Springer, 2016, Chinese translation, China Machine Press, 2020), Low-Voltage High-Resolution A/D Converters: Design, Test and Calibration (Springer, 2011, Chinese translation, China Machine Press, 2015), and Stochastic Process Variations in Deep-Submicron CMOS: Circuits and Algorithms (Springer, 2013), and he is editor of Real-Time Multi-Chip Neural Network for Cognitive Systems (River Publishers, 2019). He served as a member of Technical Program Committee of IEEE International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design, IEEE Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference, and IEEE International Symposium on VLSI, and as a technical reviewer of IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, and IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference.    \n\nHis research interests include energy-efficient mixed-signal circuit and system design for on-chip machine learning and inference, and bionic electronic circuits for autonomous cognitive systems. Dr. Zjajo won best/excellence paper award at BioDevices\u201915, LifeTech\u201919 and AICAS\u201923.",
