    "summary": "Having grown up in five different countries and with a multicultural background, I gained an open-mindedness that has enabled me to push myself out of my comfort zone many times.\n\nI\u2019ve come to realize that new experiences are the most powerful driver for personal growth! Just like how moving to a new country unlocked an enlightening cultural experience each time, signing up for theater club as a shy kid unlocked my leadership qualities by helping me conquer my fear of public speaking. Similarly, joining the swim team at my school despite being a terrible swimmer taught me humility and to always strive for personal records rather than being dissatisfied at not being the overall best at something.\n\nMy awareness of how much the world has to offer in all aspects of life gave me a rounded profile in my interests: I played instruments and took art class next to my science-focused high school diploma, and I now study a BA in philosophy next to my BSc in Nanobiology. All the while, I fill my free time with climbing, committees, and student association activities. I am truly passionate about and driven in each of my endeavors!\n\nIn particular, neuroscience, behaviorism, and AI pique my interest. I hope to contribute to these fields in my future career.",
