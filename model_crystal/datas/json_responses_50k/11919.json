During the fieldwork, I collected data from diverse NGO representatives, locals and parallel government officials along the Thai-Burmese Border and in Myanmar itself. I measured the impact of education through four variables: Redistribution, Representation, Recognition and reconciliation. The framework was developed for the Research Consortium on Education and Peacebuilding. A summary of the findings is attached in the 'Media' section at the top of my Linkedin page - if you have any questions feel free to contact me.",
