I was trained in zero waste best practices and tasked with visiting off-campus student housing to conduct face-to-face interactions. Across two semesters, my team and I reached nearly 3,000 homes. I provided zero waste tool kits and informed residents how to compost and recycle. This role required excellent communication and interpersonal skills, as well as data collection and analysis. I tracked our interactions to input in Excel to monitor our progress. Later, we analyzed and synthesized this data in a year-end report that was presented to city officials.\n\nI also worked in other areas, such as at the Recycling Center. Here, I sorted trash, compost, and recycling on a fast-paced line to remove contaminates from recyclable goods. My team and I achieved an 88% diversion rate of waste from the landfill. I also assisted in tabling events, representing the E-Center in its various messages to be more environmentally conscious, whether it be greening your home, recycling, or biking more.",
