While working on rotation, additional professional activities take place:\n\nThe outcome are ship specific improvement programs that have been designed in such a way to enable ship owners to concentrate on their core business, and not divert valuable resources into \u201cfire fighting\u201d Environmental management and regulatory non-compliance issues. \n\nOur programs work following the modern Plan Do Check and Act Cycle, after one year of post program initialisation a further audit will be performed and the management system updated.\n\nThe management system is designed, like the clean Ship Notation, to be ship specific, however the management manuals can be easily integrated at a higher management level of environmental compliance, for example ISM and ISO 14001.\n\nFor many years marine companies have spent millions on attempting to achieve \u201cRegulatory Compliant\u201d vessels following a \u201cCompliance Driven System\u201d. In many cases the system and expenditure has failed and resulted in not only damaging emissions but also debilitating financial penalties and damage to company reputation and future business opportunities.\n\nAt Ship Techno Expertise we believe that to achieve regulatory compliance a company has to set its targets higher and achieve not only a personnel but also a corporate cultural change that will provide an operating environment in which personnel engage with and understand the Environmental Management policies of the company. \n\nSTE have many years of experience in working with companies to achieve this goal through education, technical and procedural change processes. \n\nI would very much like the opportunity to discuss how we can help to improve your company\u2019s achievements in this area.",
