The billing rationalization project had the objective of mapping similar products between the organisations in order to find the potential differences in price, application and application frequency. This involved domestic and international tariff items from products as well as provisional items such as postal costs, credit line provisions, etceteras. As a result of this analysis, recommendations would be made on how to improve the differences and simulations performed with historical client transaction activity data in order to validate the recommendations. The output of this exercise resulted in basis for the future pricing for the transaction products as well as a foundation for the configuration of the new billing systems being incorporated by the organization.\n\n",

            "description": "Although different chip variations will inevitably be invented, it was predicted that the next major advancements in the short term will be in bringing parallel architecture technologies more into the mainstream. In general, this means that systems will be equipped with more than one processor with which to handle a number of operations simultaneously. In this way, hardware will be able to handle a number of tasks simultaneously and with ever-speedier chips. Thus, complex problems could fall by sheer numbers rather than by raw speed. The theory behind this is that if one processor can perform a million computations per second, then one hundred processors should be able to perform one hundred million computations in the same amount of time.",

The theories used in this present a supersymmetric representation of the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook (CHC) linear theory of spinodal decomposition (SD) and continuous ordering (CO) which relates Grassmann variables to physical objects. These supersymmetric representations suggest a new morphological description to the early stage of SD and CO, and provide insights into the process of equilibration above the critical temperature.\n\nBrief description of work\nAs a researcher, Lawrence delved into the supersymmetric problems presented by the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook theory. This included utilizing percolation and supersymmetry theory as tools in developing the main concepts in the project. Lawrence\u2019s work entailed developing and performing computer simulations using Ising model systems and validating results against proven theory.\n\nApplied methods & tech\nSimulations were produced within the massively parallel computing environment of TMC\u2019s CM2 which has a SUN Sparc1 front end running UNIX as its operating system. The actual simulation code was developed in CM Fortran. Extensive analyses were also performed on the information generated by these simulations such that the proposed hypotheses might be thoroughly explored.\n",
