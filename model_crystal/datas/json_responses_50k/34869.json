    "summary": "I am the founding director of Organisation in Design. The initiator and one of the lecturers for our programme of masterclasses: Perspective in Design. And founder and art director of Ventura Projects, our former international design exhibition platform.\n\nDesigning is a creative and intuitive profession. My company interacts as a intermediary between the design world and other companies and institutions in order to advance and promote design world wide while protecting the creative process. \nAdvancing design anyway possible. That is Organisation in Design\n\nI developed Perspective in Design, an extensive programme of masterclasses in which the subtle art of creative entrepreneurship is taught on an individual basis. Organisation in Design has implemented their broad and year long expertise in the field of design in this practical programme geared towards design studios, labels and individual designers. The programme focuses on professionalism and growth and has been proven very successful.\n\nI love taking part in advisory boards for companies and institutions such as CrowdyHouse, HKU University of the Arts Utrecht, the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) New York and the Helsinki Design Week.  I'm a regular speaker for events and institutions such as the \u201cCultural Entrepreneurship Pilot\u201d of the Creative Industries Fund, St Lucas School of Arts Antwerp, Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti (NABA) Milan. I often take part in jury or design panels for international renowned awards.\n\nAs an ambitious businesswoman, I am chairman and board member of the entrepreneurial network Sisterhood in Business, a strong national network of ambitious female entrepreneurs who use their experience, network and knowledge to guide businesses with growth ambitions.\n\nI live and work in Utrecht, The Netherlands and graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven in 2000. I followed several business courses and personal development training in the past years.\n\nStrengths: deep and complete comprehension of the inner workings of the creativity industry, art direction, connecting and mediation, consulting on design, entrepreneurship and always looking for innovation.",

It started small with a 200m2 exhibition surface and 25 exhibitors, but increased rapidly to events with over 250 exhibitors on 30.000 square meters. After the first edition the Ventura Projects returned yearly to the capital of design during the Milan Design Week. Over 150.000 visitors were welcomed at Ventura Lambrate, Ventura Future, Ventura Academies and Ventura Centrale.\n\nThe Ventura Projects had many international exhibitions such as, Ventura Berlin in 2011, Ventura Interieur in 2012 & 2014, Ventura London in 2014 and Ventura New York in 2016, 2017 and 2019. the first edition of Ventura Centrale was in 2017 and in 2018 and 2019 it returned, every year more extensive with an increasing visitors flow. In 2018 also Ventura Dubai was launched and the year after the event returned to the Middle East. In 2019 Ventura New York X Colony was initiated at Colony New York, a result of a close collaboration between curators Jean Lin and Margriet Vollenberg.\n\nThe exhibitions of Ventura Projects, are flexible concepts which were realised simultaneously with large design events. Ventura Projects focuses strongly on quality, uniqueness and research, and highlights the conceptual and new expressions of international design. It is dedicated to revolutionary design trend, unpredictable creative and social concepts, emerging talents, current design products and cross disciplinary inspirations. Over 7.000 designers, brands, companies, academies and institutions exhibited via Ventura Projects.\n\nDue to the global COVID-19 outbreak Margriet Vollenberg, founder and art director of Ventura Projects, sadly had to make the decision to stop all Ventura Projects activities.\nwww.venturaprojects.com",

                    "description": "Ventura Centrale provided a stage for brands that master the art of storytelling in the vaulted warehouses of the Milan central railway station. Through captivating installations, brands show their skills and fortitude to the design week audience. Due to the severe outbreak of COVID-19 Margriet Vollenberg, founder and art director of Ventura Projects, sadly had to make the heartbreaking decision to stop all Ventura Projects activities. Of course we will continue to work and advance international contemporary design via Organisation in Design",
