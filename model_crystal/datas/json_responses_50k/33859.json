    "summary": "My extensive supervising and educational experience, along with my excellent communication and networking skills, makes me ideally suited for a MSL/medical advisory position at a pharmaceutical company. I am proactive, enthusiastic and result-driven, engaged with good interpersonal skills. In my spare time I enjoy fine dining and adventurous sports such as scuba and sky diving. \n\nI studied Biomedical Sciences at Leiden University, The Netherlands, with a minor in Science Based Business. I did my PhD at the department of Endocrinology of the LUMC, The Netherlands. As a scientist, I very much enjoyed communicating scientific information to experts and key opinion leaders, including clinicians and industry professionals from companies such as TNO, Solvay and Abbott. I get a lot of positive energy from transferring knowledge, and therefore I have been involved in the educational program of medical and biomedical students as well as supervised numerous students. With great pleasure I have presented scientific data at many international conferences as well as organized (inter)national conferences myself. I have used various media sources, such as glossy magazines, radio and webinar to communicate my research to lay-audience. I have recently completed the MSL training \u201cfrom SCIENCE to PHARMA\u201d.\n\nI have extensive experience in interpreting scientific data, as well as writing and reviewing scientific documentation, which has given me a critical and analytical mentality. I am comfortable working either independently or in a team and I have a strong drive to assimilate and master new areas of research. I take pleasure in initiating new contacts as well as maintaining established ones which contributed greatly to the development of my extensive (inter)national network within the fields of endocrinology and neurophysiology.",
