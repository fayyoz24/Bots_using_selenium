    "summary": "\"I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails\" (Jimmy Dean)\n\nWe can't control crises, whether they are caused by climate change, war, terrorists, banks or viruses. But we can adapt plans in order to get back on track and achieve our goal. \n\nI have helped international full service airlines and low cost carriers startup, scale up, rebound and reach profitability with transformational leadership and effective strategies before. I have also built and transformed brands and organizations across cultures on four continents, and was recognized for my compelling leadership style with a swift, clear and no-nonsense approach in sophisticated and less developed markets, while delivering the revenue.\n\nIf you need help in \"adjusting your sails\" and in navigating your business into profitability with an inclusive growth and learning mindset, then I am ready to join your crew!\nI look forward to hearing from you.",
