    "summary": "Senior Operations Executive with extensive experience in the Chemical, Paper, and Pulp, Plastics, Packing Cargo security industry, and huge knowledge of working on the international scene: I have worked in the USA, Brazil, Dubai, and currently in Europe. This has led me to have a broad experience in multi-cultural leadership: working in different cultures and countries.\nExpertise and achievements lie in the areas of being able to deliver rapid and consistent growth for industries: from revenues to bottom line by leading multi-functional teams and ownership of the results.  Wide experience in Factory relocation and closure, Project management, factory construction, startups, having a decisive influence at board level; going to root-cause problem solving; in the business restructuring; and delivering a crystal clear communication style. \nFurther to this I have gained wide experience and become an expert in change management, turning under-performing businesses around, in reorganizations, in prospecting and leading M&A, increasing and substantially improving the results in the manufacturing and service industries in private areas, and at the same time showing credibility and integrity. \nThroughout his years in the industry acquired extensive know-how on turning results around; re-structuring and cleaning up companies; generating a reduction in risks and cost; eliminating structural problems and creating sustainable and continuous growth.",
