    "summary": "Hans Bakker received his PhD in Physics and Mathematics in September 1985 from the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. He joined Shell Research in its Amsterdam laboratory in October 1985 in the Materials Engineering department. His initial years in Shell were spend as a research physicist on developing inspection techniques for on-stream pipeline inspection. After various assignments in research and the business, engineering and operational experience was gathered via assignments in Singapore (area maintenance manager) and Pernis (production unit manager). In between, a job was held in consultancy in the fields of maintenance and inspection. Since 2002 Hans has been working in the projects department of Shell Global Solutions as a buiness manager. He has refurbished the Shell project management systems and was the originator of the Shell Project Academy. Based on his experience he was appointed to the chair of Management of Engineering Projects at the Delft University of Technology as a part-time professor in the summer of 2007. He has been Vice President for Contracting and Procurment and has recently taken up a special project to introduce the new way of working in the Shell offices in Rijswijk and Amsterdam.\nThe red line throughout his whole career has been change management and a clear focus on people. With effect from January 2015 he will be solely focussing on further developing the chair at TU Delft.",
