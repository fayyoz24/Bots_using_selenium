    "summary": "Nanco Dolman is lead expert in Water Resilient Cities at Deltares with a MSc in Civil Engineering from Delft University of Technology (1998) and a BLA in landscape architecture from Amsterdam Academy of Architecture (2008). From 2011 to 2016 Nanco was part time lecturer Adaptive Urban Development at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. And since 2015, Nanco serves as UN-ISDR Resilient Cities advocate.\nAs one of the Dutch front runners in Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) Nanco is specialized in bridging water resilient design and engineering in making cities less vulnerable to water extremes, urban heat, degrading environments, and on-going population growth. Following his international experience in various adaptation strategies for delta cities (a.o. Bangkok, Rotterdam, New Orleans, New York), Nanco became the Water Sensitive City expert for the EU funded Interreg CATCH research project which focusses on \"applying the Water Sensitive City framework for climate adaptation in the North Sea Region\".",
