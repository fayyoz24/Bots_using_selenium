At present I'm the Director of Karvee Business Consultancy located at Kathmandu, Nepal. As such, I am chair of the board and in charge of all company operations and management of our projects. Karvee's work focuses on public health and related fields, such as women empowerment, inclusive social policy and education.\n\nAs the director I coordinate with our local and international partners, who have expertise in different fields.
