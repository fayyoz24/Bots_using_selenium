Within that same year I was relocated to Cape Town and given the additional responsibility as Building Engineering Lead for SA West which included all the Building Engineering Practice Areas including Architecture. In 2015 AECOM promoted me to Buildings and Places South Africa where I served as a Growth Lead in South Africa. I remained in touch with my first love as an Engineer and throughout acted as The Project Engineer on many of the projects being carried out by our Business Line. In November 2015 I took over the role as the Lead Project Engineering Manager for one of AECOM\u2019s largest projects in South Africa. The Transnet Saldanha Iron ore Tippler 3 project. In 2016 Transnet requested AECOM to dedicate me on a full time basis on their project and I was deployed to site in Sladanha where I currently serve as the Project Engineering Manager on the FEL 4 project.",

I started this project in Dublin and traveled between South Africa and Ireland to coordinate the design process of the design team and deliver the design deliverables to the local site team in Dublin.
