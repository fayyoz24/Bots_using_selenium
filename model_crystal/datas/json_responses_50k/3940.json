    "summary": "In an alternate universe, I would be a music supervisor for tv shows or movies. Why?\n\nHave you experienced watching something where there is a pivotal moment in the plot and it is paired with the perfect song that makes you connect to the story and \u201cfeel all the feels\u201d? That\u2019s why. \n\nLuckily, creating meaningful experiences and connections for individuals is not limited to an alternate universe.\n\nI have years of experience in marketing and understanding customer behaviour which has translated to successful B2C product management. I enjoy trying to understand customer journeys and pain points to optimise them and create value. \n\nThrough my experience I have developed strong gut instincts but prefer to validate them and be data-driven in my decisions. I am proactive, have a hands-on mentality and approach problems with an innovative solution mindset. \n\nColleagues appreciate my \u201cability to see things from different points of views and understand the situation as a whole\u201d and openness to feedback. They describe me as having an infectious positive and personable attitude.\n\n\nSkills:\nMBA | e-Commerce | Product Management | Conversion Optimization | A/B Testing | Data Driven | Customer Experience | Strategy | Growth | Agile | Scrum | Project Management | Time Management\n\nTools:\nJira | Hotjar| Mixpanel | Adobe Analytics & Target | Google Analytics | Google AdWords | Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator & InDesign ",
