I made a VBA program to count the files in all the folders. My manager then asked me to find a way to enhance the report to show why invoices couldn't be processed immediately. I made a stand-alone application in AHK. People would select a file in Windows and then activate the app with a key combination. The app would show a window with tick-boxes for frequent issues and some entry fields for basic details (vendor, amount, date, comments). The app would save these details with the file. The details would be preserved if the file was renamed or moved. The macro in my Excel report would pick up all the details. I made this in 2017 and it is still being used.\n\nAutomating the processing of IC invoices\nOur Intercompany team receives up to 200 invoices a month. These invoices were originally booked manually. The ERP system (Oracle 11i) did have a way to upload invoice details through CSV files. Most of the booking details were provided in Excel files. However, to turn the Excel files into suitable CSV files was a cumbersome process. For most invoices, it would be more work to generate an upload file than to book it manually. In collaboration with the IC department, I designed an Excel file that would be used as a template to save all the invoice details in. I then made a VBA file that would read the invoice details, add vendor data and produce the CSV files for loading the data into Oracle. The macro would also check the posting details for common errors and send the invoices to various people for approval (automatically determining who had to approve each invoice). It would also maintain a tracker file so people could see who still needed to approve an invoice before it could be paid. This saved a lot of time. In 2022, the program was updated to make load files for SAP, as some companies had been migrated to this ERP.",
