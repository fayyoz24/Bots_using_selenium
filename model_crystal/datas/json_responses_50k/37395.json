    "summary": "I consider innovative private and public organizations as game changers in the climate and sustainability challenges today. An organization's sole purpose is to create positive value for its stakeholders and society. Organization's with a higher purpose, that provide a great product or service, create high quality employment, while optimizing social and environmental impact, are here to stay. This can be referred to MVO/CSR/Sustainability/'social' enterprises, which I really consider the fundament of positive value creation. \n\nI want to help private and public organizations be game changers by integrating sustainability in the overall strategy, coordinating and facilitating their CSR programs and sustainability projects. In this process I enjoy facilitating (multi-stakeholder) collaboration.\n\nEducated as a cultural anthropologist (BSc.) and as a sustainability and international development professional (MSc.) I understand cultural, social and organizational behavior in a time of transition. I lived in Australia, Ghana and Fiji. My previous work experience includes a position as program manager (textiles) at Solidaridad and a (organizational) change management position at PUM. \n\nCurrently I am working as business developer for Foda Silva Food Forest. Also, I am setting up a sustainable investment fund (Sailing Elephant Invest B.V.). \n \nMy way of working can be characterized as self-propelling and pragmatic. I like to understand the \u2018why\u2019 of things to be effective and efficient and enjoy working together with people, making a sincere connection with an eye for culture and interdisciplinarity. I love it when a plan comes together by co-creating, combining insights and ideas that have business value. \n\nWhen you are interested we can meet and have a coffee! ",

This as part of the policy 'Vernieuwd Welzijn (2013)'. In a presentation we presented our advisory report to the Gemeente Utrecht.\n\nThe second part of the year revolved around the public health issue of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) for which we organized a conference: Collaborative Solutions: A Live Case on RSV (see for more details: 'experience').",

To address this issue we organized one of the first conferences ever helt, called: COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS: A LIVE CASE ON RSV on the 25th of June 2014 at the head office of Medicine Sans Frontiers in Amsterdam. During this one-day meeting we brought together various stakeholders (e.g. NGOs, regulatory agencies, private actors, academic institutions, et cetera). \n\nA Live case is an approach whereby participants are taken to a third party organization (problem donor) which provides an important issue that the participants have to tackle. The participants are required to tackle an issue that is real and 'live' to the \u2018client\u2019 organization. The live case method is usually performed in compressed time-frames, with a limited amount of expert stakeholders that permit interdisciplinary as well as intens collaboration.   \n\nThe results of this day have been presented to the WHO in an unsolicited report.",

Over time I reported to the Manager PMO, PMO director and CEO.\n\nSuccess included the timely and comprehensive execution of the implementation plan and handover to management. Besides, I also was co-author of a subsidy proposal to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DDE), which was fully granted for 7 million Euros.   \n\nPUM is a Dutch non-profit organization in private sector development, through knowledge transfer by expert volunteers to small- and medium size enterprises in developing countries and emerging markets.",
