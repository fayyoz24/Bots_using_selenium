    "summary": "I work as an Art Director, Designer, and Design Strategist. I have 20 years of experience working in the design, cultural and business fields. I focus on editorial and publication design for digital and print, brand identity, and strategic design thinking.\n\nI am based in Amsterdam and I work with a clientele made up of businesses, artists, publishers, journalists, academics and other creative and interesting people from around the globe.\n\nI work with Fortune 500 companies, individual artists and designers, start-ups and non-profits, and museums and galleries. The diversity of collaborators is one of my favorite things about owning a small studio. There is always something new to learn from my clients. I'm able to bring new insights gathered from the different people I've collaborated with over the years into all aspects of my work.\n\nI see myself in my work. I am not afraid of having a distinct viewpoint, and bringing it into the conversation. By posing informed questions, making inspired choices and astutely rearranging the expected, I put my creativity to task and encourage people to see things differently. This process helps me truly understand my work and my collaborators, and challenges me to rethink my perspective every day.\n\nIn addition to my professional practice, I also teach on an irregular basis in the graduate and undergraduate programs in Graphic Design at Rutgers University in New Jersey and at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.",
