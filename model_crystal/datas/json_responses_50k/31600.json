    "summary": "I never dreamed of landing in specialty coffee. As a child, I always wanted to be a designer. And yet, after almost ten years of working in and with coffee, I've never looked back. \nCoffee excites me, it's constantly evolving and so full of surprises. Through The Coffeeevine, I've been able to do things I never thought possible. \nAs the leading specialty coffee subscription company in Europe and widely read coffee blog, The Coffeevine has brought joy and education to thousands of people around the world. It allowed me to connect and work with some of the most talented and respected people in the industry and opened the door to many fantastic collaborations with the likes of Lonely Planet, Airbnb, KLM, Soho House and more.\nIt also led me to founding Freshdrip, an innovative ready-to brew coffee dripper that produces a fresh cup of delicious filter coffee in a heartbeat and which I've supplied to the likes of Harrods and Selfridges and leading hotels like The Hoxton and more.\nI am driven and thirsty for knowledge (pardon the pun). I believe you're only as good as your last brew.\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let's have some coffee and explore the endless possibilities.",
