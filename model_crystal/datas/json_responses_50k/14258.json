I've specialized in creating aesthetically pleasing photos with a unique and out-of-the-box process. From shooting jewelry in a macro landscape to giving crash courses in wildlife photography at the Rotterdam Zoo, I've worked in a lot of different venues and for \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c (\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc012\ud835\udc01 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc012\ud835\udc02). During my time as a photographer I've learned:\n-the value of entrepreneurial persistence\n-working with international clients accounting for cultural differences\n-taking responsibility and scheduling my own time\n-the technical aspects of photography\n-editing photos and creating workflows in the following programs: Photoshop CC, Lightroom Classic CC.\n-managing expenses and tax administration (although that part was less enjoyable for me).\n-acquiring and managing various clients.  \n-building websites and creating accessible portfolios\n-Becoming with technical aspects of display calibration and different panel techniques.",

I was lucky enough to be accepted into a highly sought-after shark conservation project in Fiji. Due to the acidification of large reefs in the area, the sharks had begun to move away from the reefs which lead to a lot of these sharks ending up as by-catch for Chinese fishing vessels. The goal of this month-long project was to relocate arguably the most vicious shark, the bull shark, away from populated coasts or fishing waters and into MPAs (Marine Protected Areas). Doing this ensured the survival of the species in the region, and it being the apex predator also ensured natural population control for the reefs in MPAs.\n\nDuring this project I learned:\n-To work under extreme pressure\n-act responsibly in dangerous circumstances\n-SCUBA dive in challenging scenarios, at 30 meters and below\n-Inner workings of non-profit projects and the challenges associated with operating without much support from local government. \n-How ecological systems work. One of the things we learned from our ecological models and also ended up doing was planting mangrove trees, to rescue sharks... go figure :)\n-Marine biology (e.g. shark anatomy, fish identification)\n-Basics of underwater photography/videography"

I was tasked with organizing meetings with fun and interactive games for the kids (8-12 y.o.) that were pedagogically responsible. This challenging combination was great to tackle and gave me invaluable insight into finding ways to make theory happen in practice, and making my own adjustments on the go. As a Scout Leader, I got to teach kids how to sail, row, tie knots, make campfires, and how to interact with each other in a responsible way."
