    "summary": "Nathalie Houtermans is an experienced curator and art & culture theorist with a specialisation in developing interdisciplinary art projects in art institutions, as well as on unusual locations. She developed projects and curated exhibitions in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague, Sao Paulo, New York, Havana, Shanghai, Djakarta, Cape Town and Mumbai.\n\nShe has a broad knowledge about several art disciplines and their specific work processes. Although her main background is visual arts, she also worked with digital, video and performance artists, choreographers/dancers, architects, (graphic) designers, composers/musicians and writers. She produced new, site specific works with these artists herself.\n\nBesides working with other artists as mentioned above, her own art practice consists of being a musician. Again, in this capacity she not only works with other musicians, but also with other artists to create visual works as part of the experience of the music.\n\nShe is an experienced tutor and mentor for students on an academic level, especially for art and culture and/or theory related studies. She is specialised in tutoring neurodiverse and other students with specific needs.\n\nShe is a researcher with an elaborate formal education and experience, which she combines with her work practice in a unique way. Over the years she not only could gather a thorough theoretical knowledge about the position(s) of western art and culture as wel as societies in other parts of the world, but also implements this knowledge in the development of new art projects and cultural organisations.\n\nShe has been a pioneer in setting up flexible organisations specialised in developing temporary projects in public space and other non-art locations, with a focus on presenting high quality, 'difficult', art works to a broad audience. \nShe knows how to communicate art works on all levels for all target groups and is particularly interested in reaching an audience that has not been introduced to contemporary art yet. She knows what actually works and what absolutely not works regarding projects in public space, but keeps on exploring other approaches.",

The projects focus on the specific social context of Zuid, from which the projects are developed. Next to art buffs, the aim was to bring people from other contexts in contact with the work of international artists that are invited to offer the visitor an unbiased view on Rotterdam Zuid through their work.\n\nSensational Mix had to stop due to a move abroad of Roland Groenenboom, but there might be Sensational Mix projects on occasion.\n\nWebsite: sensationalmix.nl",
