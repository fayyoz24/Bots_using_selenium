My primary job was to make a frontend part. At first it was only some JS, many HTML/CSS templates and a simple backend based on popular site engines like WordPress. The more I learned the more I got complex tasks including developing small jQuery-based applications, for example specific calculators for consumers, complex UIs to show monitoring data and many others. At the end of my freelancer career I began to use AngularJS that was at the time the best tool for my specific tasks.\n\nI combined my freelancer work with another project called KogdaKuda. It was my first big project based on Django framework that gave my opportunity to learn Python language for web develoment, database design, UI prototyping and many other things.

Usually we talk about our own real experience and try not to give any opinion on things we didn't try ourselves. Also we make interviews with our Russian-speaking colleagues from all other the world. Our primary goals are to give different opinions on complex subjects, to educate junior developers and to tell about local meetups and conferences in Russian cities."
