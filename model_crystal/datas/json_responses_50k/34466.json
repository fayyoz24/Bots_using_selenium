    "summary": "Ingrid Siliakus first discovered paper architecture by seeing work of the originator of this art form Prof. Masahiro Chatani (architect and professor in Japan). He developed this art form in the early 1980's. Ingrid was instantly fascinated by the ingenious manner in which these pieces were designed and by the beauty they radiated. Ingrid studied the originator's work for some years and than started to design herself. Ingrid states that working with this art form has given her personal means of expressing. Her designing skills have grown over the years. Her specialties are buildings of master architects and intricate abstract sculptures. Her source of inspiration by these abstract sculptures are works of artists like M.C. Escher. With buildings she feels attracted to work of Berlage and Gaudi.\n\nSpecialties: Paper Architecture is the art of creating an object out of a single piece of paper. To design a pattern from scratch, the artist needs the skills of an architect to create a two-dimensional design, which, with the patience and precision of a surgeon, becomes an ingenious three-dimensional wonder of paper. After the design stage, creating a paper architecture art work is done by a combination of detailed cutting and folding.",
