    "summary": "Numbers are not plain characters, they can tell stories,  help you grow, change lives, as it did to mine.\n\nI was 11 years old when I won a city math competition, and that showed me a whole new world, numbers were my thing!\n\nAt 18 I\u2019ve got a full scholarship to pursue a bachelor in Business with emphasis in International Trade, and from that moment on I had the privilege to be part of great teams and projects.\n\nDuring the past 15 years I have developed my experience working at strategic FP&A teams to support business decisions at local, regional and global level in four different industries (logistics, airline, high education and cosmetics), providing data driven analysis, insights, revamping and creating new processes that helped steer the businesses in the right direction. Some examples are:\n\n- Implementing the first Finance Sub-ledger analysis cell at Kuehne Nagel Brasil, bringing more visibility and  quality to the profit recognition\n- Creating an automated Budget model at Avianca Brasil, reducing the consolidation time of 36 different units in 90%\n- Developing several financial models also at Avianca Brasil, such as Pilot and Crew manpower prediction, significantly improving accuracy\n- Implementing a comprehensive and automated Capex control at Laureate, providing visibility and allowing faster decision making for hundreds of millions of reais (BRL) in annual projects \n- Supporting the successful launch of hundreds of new products globally at Avon Cosmetics, based on cost predictions and providing strategic financial advice\n- Supporting the biggest Perishables business unit of K+N in the world, enabling data-driven decision making\n- Full review of Accounting and Reporting activities at K+N Netherlands, generating clarity, increasing accountability, while allowing a better distribution of activities, promoting an overall quality improvement\n- Developing trainings and mentoring team members with a hands-on approach, and having fun!\n\nMy journey is just at the beginning, and I can\u2019t wait for all the great challenges still on my path!",
