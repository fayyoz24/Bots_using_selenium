    "summary": "Wherever I go (for work, studies or even holidays) I end up in rural places. Different colorful cultures attract my interest and I always try to interact with these people to learn about their lives. I have a passion for learning new languages, but even with non-verbal communication we can connect with people. \n\nI studied International Tourism to try to satisfy this hunger to meet people from different cultures. While specialising in sustainable tourism, I got acquainted with development projects in Guatemala (family planning, HIV/AIDS, gender) and Peru (Fair Trade coffee cooperative). These experiences made me decide to go and study Anthropology and Development Studies (Master, Advanced Master). \n\nI have worked as a Monitoring and Evaluation officer in the Netherlands and abroad, in both West Africa (Niger) and East Africa (Uganda) in humanitarian aid and sustainable development, respectively. During my current job at Heifer, I get the opportunity to use my experience in M&E while managing various projects in Africa, Latin-America and Asia. Besides project management, I facilitate proposal development processes for Heifer which I really enjoy: being a structured organizer that easily connects with people.",
