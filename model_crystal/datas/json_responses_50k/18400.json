The project involves the development of a data-sharing and analysis platform for nutritional neuroscience data and a measurement toolbox for consumer data. These tools enable integrating data from different studies and promote meta-analysis, which ultimately leads to an increased understanding of the determinants of food choice.\n\nI received a grant for the VIRTUE project. The VIRTUE project is a collaboration between the UMCU and the neuromarketing research agency Neurensics. In the project, realistic fMRI-compatible virtual food choice environment was be developed to test the effectiveness and neural underpinnings of healthy eating interventions.\n\nFurthermore, I received a seeding grant for research on the effect of sleep deprivation on food-related self-control. \n\nFor my publication list, please see: https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=zJZiQqYAAAAJ",

The general aim of the PhD-project was to establish the potential of implicit markers to (1) predict choice, and (2) gain insight in decision-making processes underlying food choice. More specifically, the project aimed to gain more insight into processes underlying self-control (i.e., rejecting foods that are high in sugar and fat). Within the context of the project multiple functional MRI and eye-tracking studies have been performed. Results were presented on several international conferences in the field of neuroscience, psychology and consumer behavior. Additional activities included giving guest lectures and supervising MSc-students. In addition, I contributed to a subsidy proposal and I coordinated/hosted the weekly meetings of the Image Sciences Institute. The thesis defense took place at June 27th 2013.",
