    "summary": "People define me as a highly motivated person with a lot of potentials. With excellent organizational and client-oriented skills, I have developed a deep understanding of customers' needs and an eye for details. \n\nAn important key factor nowadays is the mindset! We live in a modern world with globalization expanding drastically. Nothing is impossible; it only requires a cool mind and a little bit of effort and time with a clear vision of what we want.\n\nHi there! Let me shortly introduce myself, my name is Maria, born and raised in a small town in the Netherlands, with a Turkish background who has lived across the world such as in the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Turkey (Istanbul), and China (Chengdu), and traveled to many more. \n\nWith more than a decade of experience in sales (C2B; B2B), client understandings, and representing companies such as Canon, Samsung, Philips, Sony, and Microsoft, and many more. I am able to detect the needs and negotiate for the best results. I'm always eager to learn more and drive for the best imperfection for perfection. Since there is always room for more improvements.",
