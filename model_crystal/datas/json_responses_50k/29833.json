In either way it is important to recognise and use the right material for the specific application.\n\nFiberneering can advise on the use of composites, design the best solution using both composites and traditional materials and/or assist with their implementation on site.",

Composites do not corrode and fatigue like steel and are therefore much more durable. And using our proprietary remediation processes, we can repair faster and safer than traditional processes, resulting in huge cost savings for our clients.\n\nAs business development manager, I was responsible for all sales and marketing of the company. This includes:\n\n- Obtaining relevant market data and using this to create a sound strategy for rolling out our technologies.\n\n- Identifying, selecting and maintaining the right partners and applicators.\n\n- Presenting to both contractors as well as operators to ensure all parties are aware of the benefits ICC's technologies can provide.\n\n- Initial on-site problem assessments, which was highly appreciated by technically oriented clients.\n\n- Sales budget responsibility.\n\nAs part of ICC's Senior Management team, we set the strategy for 1 and 5 year horizons, reported project and business results to the board of directors and ensuring general business matters were addressed efficiently as they came up.",
