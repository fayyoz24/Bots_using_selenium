    "summary": "I am an ambitious junior research interested in the development of AI and its connection to societal developments and trust in technology. I graduated with honours from a research MSc in Cultures of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST) at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University. My interests focus on philosophy of technology, AI ethics, and the relation between culture and new technological as well as scientific developments. \n\nDuring my Bachelor (BA) in Arts and Culture, I belonged to the best 5% of my programme which allowed me to participate in the Honours as well as Honours+ Programme at Maastricht University. I also had the opportunity to participate in the Maastricht Research-Based Learning Excellence Programme in which I focussed on scientific travel literature. \n\nI am passionate about research and would like to stay in academia after my degree. In order to work towards that goal, I have gathered research experience during a research internship at the University of Vienna together with Prof. Dr. Mark Coeckelbergh. I have also worked as a research assistant as well as a junior researcher and therefore accumulated hands-on experiences in academia. Additionally, my master\u2019s degree is research-centred and therefore offers a basis for a further career in academia.\n\nIn my free time, I attend lecture series by the Studium Generale in Maastricht and I am also part of a book club. I enjoy reading, learning new languages, swimming, cooking, and painting.",
