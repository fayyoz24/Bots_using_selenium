    "summary": "In April 2018 I started one of the most fun and challenging journeys as a Business Analyst at Accenture.\n\nHolding a Bachelor degree in E-Concept Development from the Lilleb\u00e6lt University of Odense, Denmark. And a background in already similar experience I have developed eLearning\u2019s for top Fortune 500 companies in the oil and gas industry with a high skilled team, main focus on Control of Work.\nUsing similar BA strategies to exceed customer\u2019s needs and create a solid product from start to finish. \n\nI am excited to be a Talent & Organization associate at the new T&O Operations group at Accenture. Customer and implementation support are our main focus.\nOur goal is to help our clients to improve and develop an organization and their culture by analyzing their behaviors and techniques. Based on this information we create solutions for the client to give the ability to respond to the changing market forces. Reach business goals and help them develop a safe work environment.\n\nMy position at Accenture changed my way of thinking and working. We work hard and play hard to stay focused and productive. What I\u2019ve learned until now from this journey is that communication is key to success. \nI am a team player but can be independent when needed. Finding a balance between the two is not an issue for me.\nWhat thrives me is my creative mind, finding solutions to problems in a way that also gives me the possibility to expand my knowledge, this is what I love most.\nLearning along the way is something that helps me motivate and grow. I am a fast learner and am not scared of challenges. To me it\u2019s not whether if I can do \u2018this\u2019 but if I want to learn something new. \nI am a people person, and love to communicate. Whether it\u2019s for just a chat or an interesting discussion. Curiosity is another thing I love, so ask or answering questions is something that I do. Never be scared to ask for my help or advise.\n \nMy top 5 CliftonStrengths are: Restorative - Learner - Intellection - Strategic - Responsibility\n",
