    "summary": "You work on your business with so much honesty and passion! So, surely... people will take notice and come flocking \ud83e\uddf2 to buy your stuff ASAP\u2026 any time now\u2026 right?\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Know what you want to say to your ideal customers, but have no idea how to make people listen? \n\ud83d\udea9 Not enough good inquiries coming from your website? \n\ud83d\udea9 Or worried you won\u2019t make a great first impression with your website and blogs, so you find yourself NOT wanting to shout out from the rooftops that what you do is awesome?\n\nEek, you\u2019re holding back the growth of your business! \n\nAre you open to an alternative?\n\nEvery time someone gets a chance to interact with your online brand and understand it better, there are so many psychological intricacies at play. Or, you know... when they decide to move right past you and onto your competitors. \n\nMost of these details aren't immediately visible to the casually-browsing eye. Yet your audience *feels* their impact. And acts on it. Each and every word matters - those you use and those you don't. \n\nBuilding connection is a fragile art (and science), so no wonder compelling writing is tricky to produce - even for the most intentional businesses. \n\nActually, it's tricky *especially* for intentional business owners. Because they're already so up close and personal with their offering. And, let's be honest, they already wear tens of hats in their businesses, every day.\n\nIt's all good though. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb I\u2019m here to help you make your voice heard and make a splash in the vast online world, with zero overwhelm or hesitation, by strategizing with you and writing your high-converting website and blogs.\n\nI'm here to show you that you CAN:\n- stop second-guessing the impression you make on your audience\n- position your business as a clear, trustworthy authority in your field\n- start being confident that they feel authentically connected to you\n\nThe bottom line becomes clear: more sales, more impact, more freedom.\n\nThe better we express ourselves, the easier we can find our tribe: those we connect with, whom we can support, and who can support us back. \n\nI'll take care of your website copy and blogs in a get-sh#t-done style - which is hard to miss if you've ever had a taste of the tech startup scene: buttery smooth work processes, transparent explanations of what psychology principles work in your copy and where, and helping you work smart not hard. \n\nDo you see any value in us getting to know each other? Connect with me on LinkedIn with a quick message (just like you would in real life) or email me at laura@lauracreative.eu.\n\nSee you on the other side!",

When someone judges your brand by your website for the very first time, it\u2019s a make-it-or-break-it moment. Have your brand\u2019s words flow as their eyes gaze on their screens.\n\n\u2023 SEO blogs - For when you want your business to be found by people with the specific needs and pain points that you can alleviate. Guide people toward solutions you truly believe in. And become a trusted expert while you\u2019re at it.\n\n\u2023 Mini website copy audit - For when your website knows how to walk, but hasn't learned how to fly yet. Let your brand take centre stage for one hyper-focused hour, under my warm and clear guidance. Roll up your sleeves and I\u2019ll help you rewrite a website that sounds like you and works for you. \n\n\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d?",

Someone with wisdom and passion about PHP, since you would be responsible for the backend. The team are all full-stack developers and their strengths lie on the frontend (React, Redux, Typescript), where we invite you to contribute too.\n\nCan you imagine starting work every day with a plan to make good decisions with your team, based on arguments and reason? Critique our code if you may, we like it. For people who don\u2019t like pointless meetings, these 4 developers at Hotelchamp really make the most use of their time together in conversations - and then work independently, hands-on, in a mature tech environment. Moreover, remote work is the way to work in 2020, not only now with Corona, but in the future too - we only meet weekly, with the tech team, at our office in Groningen.",
