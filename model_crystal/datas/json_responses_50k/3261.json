Mosasaur \u2018\u2019Carlo\u2019\u2019, as it is known locally, was discovered on September 10th by a quarry employee (Carlo Brauer) in the flint-rich Lixhe 3 Member (Gulpen Formation, Maastrichtian). Preparation is still ongoing by a group of (experienced) volunteers, however the material so far includes: partial jaw sections, a (distorted) premaxilla, a pterygoid, an angular, and multiple elements of the axial skeleton. The taphonomic setting is unlike the normal pattern generally observed higher in the section, as individual bones are scattered over a wide area; bones are often distorted, and their surface heavily abraded. \nThis mosasaur is most likely Prognathodon-like based on the morphology of the heterodont dentition, which resembles that of Prognathodon sectorius (previously L(e)iodon sectorius), features including: a swollen base in tooth outline, labiolingually flattened crowns and sharp carinae. Based on the stratigraphy, the given age estimate of 67.83 Ma, means that it is 1.5 Myr older than the Prognathodon saturator (or \u2018B\u00e8r\u2019). It is unlikely, however if this turns out to be Mosasaurus hoffmanni than it would be the oldest known specimen.\n\n(from:\nSchulp, A.S. and Jagt, J.W.M. 2013. \u2018\u2019Carlo\u2019\u2019, A new Prognathodon-like mosasaur from the type Maastrichtian.

Most likely concerning Dyrosaurus maghribensis, this was mistakenly identified as Phosphatosaurus gavialoides Bergounioux 1955, the latter being an extinct genus of early Eocene crocodylomorph known from Tunisia and Mali. \nThe specimen consists of 4 pieces, ranging from 50 cm to over a meter in length, comprising much of the axial skeleton and a virtually complete skull. It is encased in a secondary matrix (i.e. added later on) wrapped in a plaster cover. Preservation of the specimen is excellent and little additional work was done to the specimen. It was obtained in December of 2002 and registered in Museon and given the specimen number #228050. \nThis relatively new Dyrosaurus species is currently only known from Morocco (Jouve, et al. 2006). It can be distinguished from D. phosphaticus (the only other species in the genus), present in contemporaneous levels of Algeria and Tunisia, by several autapomorphies, including a smooth dorsal margin of the parietal and widely opened choanae. Phylogenetic research (using 47 taxa and 234 morphological features), place the dyrosaurids as the sister taxon of pholidosaurids, the latter including Elosuchus, Sarcosuchus, Terminonaris and Pholidosaurus, and the thalattosuchians. Phylogenetic problems surrounding the longirostrine clade remain, and the blurry evolutionary relationships amongst the crocodyliforms can only be solved with more analyses and findings.''\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. St\u00e9phane Jouve and Dr. Nathalie Bardet for help with identification.\n\n(from:\nJouve, S., Iaroch\u00e8ne, M., Bouya, B., and Amaghzaz, M.

The latter is a mere cast, most likely from another ichthyosaur present in the collection of the museum in Bristol, the rest is comprised of actual fossil material. Both the front paddles and the rear are attached to the body, the former have a width of 155cm and the latter of 68cm. The total skull length was 120 cm, completing the total length to 575cm.\nThe ichthyosaur (registered as Leptopterygius sp., #96270) was purchased in 1989 by the educational museum in The Hague, The Netherlands (Museon). This ichthyosaur originates from the Church Cliffs, Lyme Regis, and is exquisitely preserved in three dimensions (which is quite rare for this locality). It was conserved in a large chalk concretion, in barely hardened clayish deposits, which allowed 3D preparation by Bagnoli, S. The estimated age was noted as Lower Jurassic, Hettangian (~200 Ma).     \nThe complete weight of the fossil was around 750kg before preparation and currently weighs up to 190kg. The preparation process, including acid treatment of the chalk concretion, has taken roughly 7 months to be completed.\n",
