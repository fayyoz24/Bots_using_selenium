    "summary": "Enthusiastic, an inspirer and connector, that is how I would describe myself. My work experience and study have ensured that I can use good technical knowledge to solve social and policy problems. I like to strategically apply my technical analytical knowledge to create social impact. In particular, I focus on developing a stronger, sustainable future! The energy transition is a huge challenge but at the same time an excellent opportunity. When the right parties are brought together, it offers enormous opportunities for society. We can achieve an enormous amount of things by bringing together entrepreneurship, corporates, policymakers and research institutes. The challenge is to bring the right people together at the right time. With my broad knowledge background and network, I work every day to discover possible new equivalences and thus possible solutions to social problems.",

It is an excellent opportunity for companies to meet internationally oriented top students within the network of FRESH students and to present career opportunities. This year's theme is applications of Big Data to better appreciate buildings now and in the future. With a group of 20 students, various leading companies in the Netherlands and New York will be visited to gain new insights on this subject and ultimately give a final presentation about it. \n\nWithin the Company Relations function, I set up collaborations with companies in the Netherlands and New York. Some of the activities are, discussing sponsorship deals, discussing substantive workshops and presentations and a fun, educational interpretation of the company visits.",

When the Ministry of Home Affairs defined the challenge of natural gas-free neighborhoods as one of the challenges within the Startup in Residence program, we at De Energiebespaarders saw this as an excellent opportunity to use our knowledge and experience for to work out a solution. After completing the selection process, we eventually became the winner of the challenge of natural gas-free neighborhoods. This was the starting signal to continue working on the concept in collaboration with the Ministry of the Home Affairs. After an intensive pressure cooker with many expert interviews and literature research, the concept has turned into a real solution; Building Blocks. Building Blocks is a coordinated solution to remove every neighborhood from natural gas by helping residents, the municipality and market parties with a total solution. By mapping needs, problems and fears, solutions were developed in the form of Building Blocks. The online and offline solution uses user-centered design and behavioral psychology (e.g. nudges and influence mechanisms) to stimulate desired behavior.\n\nSince the development of the idea, I am taking the leading role in managing the team of product developers. With a team of 8 experts, we are currently working on the different components of the solution. During the development phase, we work closely with our customers; home-owners and municipalities to ensure that our product is exactly fitting to their needs. Next to doing the project management, I spend my time to arrange partnerships with municipalities and universities to set up pilot projects throughout the Netherlands.",
