For this, multiple different finite element analyses are performed, after which this data is used to create various surrogate models. These surrogate models had to present the total dissipated energy, as a function of the thickness, width and height of the tube. Extra finite element analyses are performed to verify these surrogate models. The finite element analyses are performed in Abaqus.",
