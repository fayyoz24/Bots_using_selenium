    "summary": "Presently working at SNV as Senior Agriculture / Value Chain Advisor in a COVID-19 response and resilience project (CORE) providing backstopping, guidance and exchange/learning to a portfolio of nine major ongoing projects. These large projects are implemented by the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) and financed by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA). My specific responsibilities are climate and socio-economic resilience strengthening through consumer orientation in local food chains and markets, making optimum use of digitalization and rapid analytics. Before rejoining SNV, I worked at the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), a joint institution of African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries and the EU under the Cotonou Agreement. I was part of the CTA management team and managed an investment portfolio of 20M Euro in innovative value chain projects with a special emphasis to integrate digitalisation in agribusiness and value chain development. Before joining CTA, I was SNV team leader of a large World Bank-funded value chain project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and co-managed two large value chain projects in Nepal funded by respectively the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n\nI am educated in both agricultural science and agribusiness, and my interest is in the area of new institutional economics. This uses transaction risks for explaining business arrangements or the way \u201cbusiness is being done\u201d as brought further to perfection with Nassim Taleb\u2019s 'Skin in the Game'. The experiences with an innovative value chain project in Ethiopia, I extensively documented in the publication 'Pro-poor Value Chain Development, Private sector-led innovative practices in Ethiopia'.\n\nI am result-oriented and analytical by nature, and able to stimulate team members to innovate and perform. With my proven track record in programme and project development, acquisition and management, I managed larger portfolios and projects in several countries, often in difficult circumstances.\n\nAs an expert in developing agribusiness, I drive innovative solutions for sustainable markets, climate-smart adaptation, digitalisation, food and nutrition security, and youth and women entrepreneurship.  I completed long-term management and advisory assignments in Asia, Africa, and Europe, covering 8 countries and working in international development with diverse funding bodies.",
