    "summary": "I strive for learning experience and maximizing my potential in everything that I do. I like to challenge myself and keep an open mind about the different perspectives in the world around me. My working experience in United Kingdom and Germany, at early age, has helped me to appreciate, enjoy and see opportunities in intercultural communication with people. This was one of the guiding motives to start pursuing a BASc in International Human Resource Management in the Netherlands. However, getting out of my comfort zone can also be noticed in my additional studies, through participating in the Top Talent Honours Program \u2018\u2019Innovation and Business Creation\u2019\u2019 where I put in practice the understanding of how businesses and organizations work and at the same time be aware of the innovative approaches in the field.",
