    "summary": "A Senior Project Engineer with over 10 years\u2019 experience, I have design and project management experience in the petrochemical industry with two years spent in the Middle East. Currently based in the Netherlands, I am a project manager leading construction projects in Europe.\n\nHaving worked for clients including Rijkswaterstaat, Prorail, BAM, Shell, Saudi Aramco, Statoil and Air Products, I have undertaken numerous site roles relating to safety and quality assurance, covering all construction phases as well as gaining experience in claim disputes and settlement. I am experienced in detailed engineering design, project and operational management and supporting civil proposals and studies.\n\nI am a commercially minded self-starter with experience shaping new ventures and coordinating multidiscipline teams across several locations. While much of my experience involves work within multicultural teams, I have a desire to build relationships and have promoted collaboration between organisations on several joint ventures in which I have been involved. \n\nI am seeking opportunities that match my ambition to progress my career within engineering fields and to gain professional development opportunities by joining a dynamic and progressive work environment with access to a diverse range of challenges.",
