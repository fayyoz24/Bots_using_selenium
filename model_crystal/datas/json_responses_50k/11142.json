                    "description": "Research description:\nTo learn in an efficient way, people need to judge their learning process to find out what they have learned and more importantly what they yet have to learn. This self-assessment of the learner is important for self-regulation in learning. This link between self-assessment and self-regulation is of high importance since self-regulation leads to better learning outcomes. The assessment by the learner of how well information is learned and comprehended is called a judgment of learning (JOL). JOLs can contribute to learning because they can be used to regulate further studying. To effectively regulate further studying, JOL\u2019s must be accurate. However, JOL accuracy is generally quite low. Instructions have been proposed to improve JOL accuracy. Even though, problem-solving tasks are frequently used in education in subjects like science, math or biology, little is known about JOLs and their accuracy in this domain. Therefore, my research focuses on JOLs and problem solving with worked examples and the effects of instructions to improve JOL accuracy, self-regulation and learning outcomes in primary and secondary education.",
