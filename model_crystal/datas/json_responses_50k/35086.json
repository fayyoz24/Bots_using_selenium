                    "description": "I made coffee and served doughnuts for an A grade on my internship report! Just kidding.... \n\nI wrote copies for Nuffnang's blogs, coordinating on giveaway details and event planning for both in-house and on-ground activities. I was also the forefront in blogger enquiries, tasked to look upon the help tickets sent over from the website.\n\nEvents I've worked on: \n\n- Nuffie's Laser Tag: An in-house event for the staffs of Netccentric, Nuffnang, and ChurpChurp to come together for a day of fun in line with Nuffnang's spirit of a work life balance. \n\n- Nuffnang Birthday Bash 2013: The annual birthday celebration on the birth of Nuffnang! The team also contributed in creating a storm on Twitter with the hashtag #NNBB2013 as we took first place on the Twitter trend board.\n\n- Nuffnang's exclusive movie premieres, happening in various cinemas around Klang Valley.",
