More precisely, it was about doing a trek to the famous Grenoble's Bastille and at the same time conduct some activities, which were leadership and teamwork oriented. \n\nThe reason why we chose to start this project was mainly that we are aware that studying abroad in a highly international environment might be shocking and difficult for some students. As a consequence, the aim was to let new students understand that internationalism is an incredible opportunity that people need to understand and grasp immediately.\n\nMeeting new people, networking, collaborating, socialize and take leadership, were all the keywords that were characterizing the day. I really hope I made a good impact on the school and I also hope I have helped new students to better appreciate the new path they are about to start. ",
