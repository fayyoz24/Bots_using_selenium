    "summary": "Transport economist with more than 40 years of experience in consulting and research over a broad range of transport fields and projects related to shipping, ports, inland transport modes such as railways, road and inland waterways, combined transportation and logistics and related developments of quantitative models and computer programs.\n\nI did/participated in a great number of economic and financial evaluations of projects in the logistics and transport sector all over the world, projects funded by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and bi-lateral aid. A number of these resulted in publications on the IAME Congresses and maritime journals. \n\nStudies on port competition concerned West Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, South East Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Inland waterway development projects concerned Colombia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea and inter-island shipping projects were in Indonesia, Greece and Vanuatu. \n\nFrom 2000 to 2003 I gave courses on maritime economics in the framework of MEL at the Erasmus University.\n\nIn the period of 1970 \u2013 1974 I participated in three long-term forecast studies (with a time horizon up to the year 2000!) which are interesting from a historic, philosophical point of view, viz. \n(1) Netherlands Integral Traffic and Transport study, \n(2) Transport study for the Rio Magdalena Area in Colombia and \n(3) Energy forecast with respect to the fast-breeder nuclear project of Kalkar for the Debenelux countries.",

The project was set up in two phases. The first phase focused on the diagnostics and the scoping of key issues that influence or deter the use of waterways transport. In the second phase estimates of the magnitudes of possible modal shifts to the waterways were developed using a tailor-made modal shift model, and the reductions in fuel consumption and GHG emissions that these delivered.\n\nPhase 1: Inventory of the position of inland navigation and coastal shipping within the logistics system in Vietnam and the barriers for their development:\n- Identification of key regulatory, institutional and infrastructure impediments \n- Scoping of key issues that influence, or deter, the use of the waterways\n- Delivery of preliminary recommendations for enhancements\n\nPhase 2: Feasibility of various measures to increase the use of inland and coastal shipping:\n- Development a modal shift model to estimate the impacts of measures in the transport network\n- Defining possible interventions aiming to promote the use of IWT and coastal shipping\n- Analysing these interventions using the modal shift model, and subsequently making cost benefit analyses of each intervention.\n- Recommendation of regulatory changes and infrastructure improvements\n- Integration of findings and recommendations\n",
