    "summary": "In my opinion, the best motivation factor is the combination of aspiration and purpose!\n\nFrom a young age, I enjoyed testing my problem-solving abilities, analysing difficult situations and finding the optimal action path to resolve them.  In fact, I would often listen to my dad, a successful Civil Engineer/Developer, talk about the various management issues he would face at work, and I would try to put myself in his place.  \n\nThis inspired me to study International Business Administration to deeply understand every aspect of the \"Business world\u2019\u2019. \n\nMy status:\n\n- Second-year student at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.\n-Currently being enrolled on Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst of the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI)\n- Completed the \u2018\u2019Financial Markets\u2019\u2019 course at Yale University with honours distinction.\n- Completed the \u2018\u2019Behavioural Finance\u2019\u2019 course at Duke University.\n\nDuring my studies and my participation in various sports, I have learned to work more efficiently under pressure by having successful time management, good communication, discipline, and determination.\n\nAll the above is only the beginning of my journey to reach my aspiration and align with my purpose. My aspiration has no limits, and my purpose is to help organisations, firms, and businesses to achieve their goals in a way that creates a positive environment through cooperation, communication, mutual respect, and tolerance.",
