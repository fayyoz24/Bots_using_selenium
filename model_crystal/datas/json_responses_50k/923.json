Zo heb ik mijn kennis verbreed en praktijkervaring opgedaan met thema's als continu verbeteren, procesverbetering, samenwerking, projectmanagement, organisatieontwikkeling, training en coaching.\nDaarnaast heb ik mezelf enorm kunnen uitdagen en ontwikkelen door de verschillende interne projecten die ik aan kon pakken en de begeleiding en kansen die ik gedurende het jaar kreeg.
