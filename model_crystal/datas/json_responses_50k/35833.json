I also got the opportunity to go to Silicon Valley and help out some of our merchants with customisation of their HPP.\n\nThe following two years I worked on the Content & Documentation team, where my focus was on the merchant facing websites. I worked on the marketing website (Magnolia), documentation platform (Confluence), support platform (Zendesk) and the API Explorer (SPA, Swagger). The last few months I was mainly focussed on rewriting the API Explorer to Vue and implementing new components for the Marketing website in Vue.",

Our customers were small merchants but also large ones, like Graphic Matters, MINDEF, Bauknecht, Whirlpool, IJspaleis and the Keter Group. \n\nFor the Keter Group we built a custom media library (similar to Bynder), which was then used by all marketing departments all over the world to share their product information.\n\nWithin Webfish, I was responsible for the sales, account management, partnerships (agencies and freelancers), as well as writing technical designs and requirements. Next to that I was in charge of the frontend development of all of the websites.",
