    "summary": "As a highly motivated aerospace engineering student, I am driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to solve demanding challenges. With a Bachelor's degree from TU Budapest and ongoing studies at TU Delft, I have developed a solid foundation in the field and I am constantly seeking new challenges to further my knowledge.\n\nDuring my time at TU Budapest, I participated in Formula Student for three years, working alongside a team of talented individuals to design and build a race car from scratch. This experience taught me invaluable skills in project management, team collaboration, and problem-solving under pressure, and solidified my affection for motorsports. Here I fell in love with high-end composite structures, which are my main interest. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also gained practical experience working in my family's business, where I honed my skills in designing and working with precision measurement instruments and engineering patents.\n\nOverall, I am passionate about engineering and dedicated to positively impacting the field. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am committed to delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations and drives progress forward.",
