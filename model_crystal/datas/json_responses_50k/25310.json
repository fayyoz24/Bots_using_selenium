    "summary": "Hello!\n\nI'm Clara and I am the Label Manager at bitbird: a creative music label based in The Netherlands, founded and spearheaded by electronic music producer San Holo. We release beautiful electronic music and I work hard to ensure our sound is heard by audiences everywhere.\n\nI've worked in the Music Industry for 10 years and have always been completely in love with what I do.  \n\nBefore working at a label I was all about live music, and during my 20s I participated in the curation, booking, contracting and production of over 500 concerts (from 150 to 20.000 pax).\n\nI was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) but now live in Amsterdam (The Netherlands), so I learned how to speak Dutch to be able to properly describe the 5 different kinds of rainy weather they have.\n\nI am mostly a nerd when it comes to working or studying, but since my Gen Z colleagues describe me as \"cool\", I have chosen to believe them.\n\nI am always happy to meet new people, so feel free to reach out about the label or any other music related topic!",
