    "summary": "I'm a web backend developer with mid-to-senior level experience. \n\nMy primary language is C# (\u2764). Also I somewhat frequently use Golang(\ud83c\udf1f) and Python(\u2b50) in my work. Have some minor experience with Rust (one small pet project - telegram bot) and F# (frequently played with and learned the language, but unfortunately still don't have any notable projects with it).\n\nI Have worked with various back-end middleware such as:\n\ud83e\udd47PostgreSQL\n\ud83e\udd47Oracle\n\ud83e\udd47SQL-Server\n\ud83e\udd47Redis\n\nHave somewhat minor experience (but very much would like to know and more) with:\n\ud83e\udd47Elasticsearch,\n\ud83e\udd47Redis\n\nLove debugging complex bugs, dream about developing my own custom relational DB for educational purposes.",
