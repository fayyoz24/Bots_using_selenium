A place that invites us to explore who we are in relation to our surroundings. \n\nAs a teacher educator at the VU centre for teaching and learning, I am involved in several programs and projects contributing to teacher's professional and personal development. \n\nNext to that, I offer 1-on-1 (systemic) coaching and training for individuals and teams who wish to return to their natural state of flow again. We will look at unwanted and repeating patterns as the source to transform towards wholeness.\n\nLet's work together!",
