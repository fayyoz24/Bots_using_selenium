    "summary": "I am one of those fortunate ones who have found what they love to do during undergraduate study. In the span of four years, I was deeply attracted to legal studies as it is an art of holding a balanced, and rational view in examining the world. Therefore, becoming a professional in the legal field has ever since rooted deeply in my mind. From my extensive exposure to the various facets of law, one particular area that has a gravitational pull to draw me in is arbitration and dispute resolution law.  It was precisely this reason that I attended the research project conducted by Dr. YU Chengyong from Shandong University in his study of model law and its enlightenment on international commercial arbitration. I specifically looked into the Belt and Road initiative in China and cases where disputes were resolved consensually through reaching contractually binding settlements. The UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration is an international effort in providing an exampling document for practices and it has a pragmatic implication for businesses in China. Exposures like such kindled my passion to be part of the reform effort in the business sector in China, especially against the backdrop of this increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Outside of academia, In mid-2019, I first worked with Jilin Fengman District Procuratorate as an intern prosecutor where I was primarily involved with sorting files and legal documents and has familiarized myself with the basic procedures within the legal system in China from various trials, hearings, and depositions. The highlight of my professional career thus far would be my paralegal position with Beijing Docvit Law Firm beginning from late 2020. In one particular case of merger and acquisition, I assisted in the signing and closing of transactions. Working with lawyers, I coordinated due diligence efforts and review of disclosure schedules, monitored deal progress to confirm that internal deadlines are met and international policies complied with, and drafted documents to form and maintain legal entities, including articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder consent. In handling over 40 cases and researching on over 5,000 Chinese enterprises at the organization, I am now equipped with excellent oral and written communication skills, analytical and logical reasoning, knowledge of substantive law and legal procedures in China, as well as a strong client service which will be stepping stone for my future career development.",
