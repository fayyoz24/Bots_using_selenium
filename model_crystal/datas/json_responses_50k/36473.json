A prominent application of digital twins in healthcare is the creation of patient-specific simulations. By developing virtual replicas of an individual\u2019s disease \u2013 reflecting their unique physiological characteristics, medical history, and genetic information \u2013 healthcare professionals can gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions about patient care. These virtual models allow for testing various treatment options in a risk-free environment, thus aiding in personalizing and optimizing medical treatments. Digital twins can help predict and monitor disease progression, simulate the effects of different medications, and provide real-time feedback on treatment outcomes. By leveraging digital twins, healthcare providers can enhance patient outcomes and offer more precise, individualized care. What sets Twinome Health apart is its capability to continually integrate new patient data into the digital twin, enabling more accurate predictions akin to weather forecasting. In contrast, other patient clinical decision support approaches are static, based on a single moment. Twinome Health adopts a longitudinal approach, tracking the patient throughout their treatment.",

Improving value propositions and results of health tech start-, scale-ups and turn arounds. \n\nWhat is healthcare tech? At its core, healthcare tech refers to technology-enabled products and services in healthcare. Distinct from medical devices and diagnostics, healthcare tech focuses on facilitating and enabling healthcare functions. \n\nHealthcare tech is a vast, hyper-fragmented field. Individual companies may serve a specific vertical, such as pharmaceuticals, medical technology, providers, or regulators, in a portion of that vertical\u2019s value chain. In that context, individual companies usually fulfill a specific need, for example, digitizing core processes or providing digital health solutions. Healthcare tech companies can provide or facilitate anything from electronic medical records to clinical trial management software.\n\nDue diligence for a start/scale-up is something of a contradiction in terms if you think about it. It\u2019s a process that aims to give the technical, legal and financial grounds upon which a startup can gain investor support. Yet the process of getting a start/scale-up due diligence portfolio up and running is a labor intensive and greatly time consuming one that start/scale-ups, trying to keep margins narrow, often lack the resources to properly do. With a reported 47% of investments in startups falling through due to unsatisfactory due diligence, how is a company to beat the resources conundrum? How is a startup to get its ducks in a row to land an investment?\n\nThe answer lies in the value of knowing the due diligence craft. Knowledge is power and knowing how to prep accounts for half of your potential success.\n\n[Due diligence | Health tech | AI | Medical Device | Life Sciences | serial Rainmaker]",
