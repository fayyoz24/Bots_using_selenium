    "summary": "Think of your online presence as your brand. You control how it appears \u2013 professional and meaningful. Picture being able to use your social presence, genuinely build trust in business relationships, and create opportunities that align with your professional goals - that's where I come in to help.\n\nMy mission is to enable global B2B companies to thrive in today's digital age. At Tricycle, my role is to guide businesses and individuals towards success in the online world by providing targeted tool adoption and training, focussing on platforms such as LinkedIn.\n\nThe work I do pushes me and the journey has been incredibly rewarding. I have the pleasure of leading many exciting projects, including the \"Social Selling Academy\" for Microsoft Germany since 2021, the \"TIP LinkedIn Ambassador Program\" which is now in its third cycle with TIP Group, and the \"BeLux Leading Voices Executive Coaching Program\" for Accenture.\n\nAs we navigate this digital landscape, my personal goal is to bridge the gap between technology and human interaction. Being in a time when the online world can be overwhelming, I firmly believe that authentic professional and personal branding is the key to success. By crafting a compelling story, shaping your online presence, and being proactive and strategically visible, you can not only stand out, but also build trustworthy relationships with both your target audience and like-minded professionals that will drive you forward in the future of work.\n\nYet I know that time is a precious commodity and we are all overloaded with day-to-day commitments. That's why I advocate a smart investment of time. It's not about adding endless hours to something; it's about making strategic decisions that align with your long-term goals. While it's no secret that I love adding some sparkle to my life \u2014 not all that glitters is gold, so making the RIGHT choice can help you get the most out of your investment!\n\n\u2708 Born and raised in Germany with an Italian parent, I have a great appreciation for different cultures. I love to travel and have lived in several countries including the US, Sweden, Qatar, Indonesia and the Netherlands.\n\nIf you're up for sharing ideas, chatting about best practices, or just brainstorming, you can reach out to me here or at l.lucchese@tricycle-europe.com.",

In 2019, it took place in Portugal for 3-days. However, it was forced to move fully digital due to the pandemic. \n\nWhen I joined the team 2-months before the international in-person event, I started with taking over the technical operations such as communication between the speakers and the external tech team during the event. Afterward, I got more and more involved with the post-event communication with the press, participants and other stakeholders. As a result, I fully evolved in my role. In the end, I was fully in charge of all marketing & PR activities including website, newsletter and social media management. As we moved into virtual events, technical execution and sign-up procedure were organized by me.\n\nKeynote speakers included former \ud835\udde8\ud835\udde1 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff for Bhutan Lhatu Wangchuk (Happiness Index) | \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude07\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2 Dr. Vandana Shiva | Member of the Board of Trustees of the \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude06 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 Adam Rockefeller Growald | Investor, entrepreneur, and editor of '\ud835\udddd\ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddde -- \ud835\uddd4 \ud835\udde9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddee' Stephen Kennedy Smith | & more.",
