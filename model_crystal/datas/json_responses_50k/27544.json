Over 32 years experience in large, medium and small E&P companies and now involved with a start-up company for developing geothermal energy in The Netherlands. Cost of geothermal wells are (too) high and only with significant government subsidies can geothermal projects be made profitable.\nThe main objective for this new company is to design and drill geothermal wells significantly cheaper without compromising well integrity to enable larger scale application of geothermal energy. Our ambitious goal is to make geothermal energy cheaper than natural gas delivered energy.\n",

Caracal Energy has just started operations in Chad last year and on 30th of Sept 2013, the first oil was pumped in the connection pipeline which connects to the pipeline to Cameroon. This is an exiting development as 31 exploration wells need to be drilled in next two years and 3-4 fields will be taken into production soon. Oil production is planned to rise to between some125,000bbl/d and 250,000bbl/d dependent on exploration successes. However, geological deposition model is well understood and chances of success are rated high.\n\nCurrently 3 drilling & workover rigs going but this will be expanded rapidly to 9 rigs by end 2014. As such there are various rotational jobs available in Chad various (senior) well engineer positions, completion engineers, drilling supervisors, etc.",
