    "summary": "I am the Data Science Manager at RTL, where I take on the challenges of a broadcaster, such as delivering content more personally. I was previously at Blendle, leading a team of data scientist and engineers to help the news aggregator become more data-driven and the user experience more personal.\n\nIn June 2016, I defended my PhD thesis 'Context & Semantics in News & Web Search', that is available for download at: http://daan.odijk.me/thesis. My research covers a broad spectrum but is always motivated by applications.\n\nAs an applied researcher, I actively pursue collaborations to put research into practice. I enjoy bridging disciplines and the challenges of working with a team to use data to improve a product experience.",

In all collaborations, I was responsible for both technical aspects and project management.\n\nProfessional Activities:\n- I joined the Editoral Board of IPM (Elsevier) in 2016. I have been a reviewer for journals (including TKDE, COMIND, IRJ, IPM) and PC member for conferences such as ECIR\u201914 Tutorials, RuSSIR\u201914 & \u201915, SIGIR\u201915 & '16 Short Papers, Hypertext\u201915 DH, CIKM\u201915.\n- As member of the Graduate Studies Committee, I advised the Faculty of Science about the quality and performance of the educational programs for PhD candidates.\n- As member of the local organization of ECIR\u201914 in Amsterdam I was responsible for the logistics during the conference and the arrangements with the venue. For WSDM'17 in Cambridge, UK, I am the information director.\n\nUniversity-level Teaching: \nMy educational duties as a PhD Candidate include organizing PhD-level reading groups, teaching courses and supervising students, both at BSc. and MSc. level. Together with Dr. Edgar Meij (Yahoo! Labs, Barcelona) and Dr. Krisztian Balog (University of Stavanger, Norway), I presented tutorials on Entity Linking and Retrieval at WWW\u201913, SIGIR\u201913 and WSDM\u201914 (focused on semantic search).",
