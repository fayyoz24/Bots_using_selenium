As a developer, it's nice having a tool in your pocket that can access most forms of data, and I've become quite a fan. I've received (VAR-specific) training for FME and maintained contact with the developing company since I've started working with it.\n\nThe best about using FME is being part of the international community, in which sharing knowledge plays a vital part. I've created two custom plug-ins for this community while at Vicrea, the Stuf-Geo Vertical Messages Reader and the VertexAngleCalculator Custom Transformer. Both are available on the FME Hub and accessible to anyone using the software.",
