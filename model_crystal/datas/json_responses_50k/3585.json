The aim of the project was to study the recycling processes and the lifecycle of lightweight foam materials and compare the recycling process between Finland and the Netherlands. Our team received the topic of polymer foam material, where we then narrowed it down and focused on polyurethane. We contacted specialised companies and conducted a literature analysis to gain knowledge on our topic.",
