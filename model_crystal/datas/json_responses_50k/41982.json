    "summary": "During my PhD research at the Farming Systems Ecology group I looked at ways to sustainably redesign smallholder farming systems in Northern India. I am interested in farmers\u2019 objectives and constraints and based on this I model how changes in farm management influence their livelihoods. Point of departure is the cohesion between systems-components soil, crops, animals, manure and the household.\nMy drive to understand processes and systems is not limited to farming systems. My interdisciplinary education makes me see human as part of bigger systems with drivers and challenges.",

Different energy technologies are available to generate energy from these products: combustion, gasification, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion. Among them anaerobic digestion (fermentation) is the main common technology used on-farm. With the adjusted model, the consequences of anaerobic combustion, and of the potential trade-offs involved in the use of crop products and manures for energy production can be explored. ",

On +/- half a hectare, a high variety of vegetables and fruits (>70 species) was cultivated. Products were sold in vegetable boxes (box-scheme) and in organic shops in the region. \n\nBesides the agricultural activities, a 'care component' was integrated in the farm: a day a week we worked in the garden with refugees from the local detention centre.",
