Focusing on Malaysia, a non-signatory to the Geneva Refugee Convention, the study analyzes the impact of this status on the ability of displaced persons to empower themselves and affect their voices. The research employs legal storytelling approaches to showcase the lives of forced migrants through their narratives. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding and integrating the perspectives of displaced individuals in the development of more inclusive and effective policies.",
