Programming was done using Fortran Language.\nPart I: The motion of a wave across a one dimensional domain was observed in time using various numerical schemes and stability of each scheme was observed.\nPart 2: The travel of a disturbance over a 2-D domain was observed. The governing equation was Poisson equation. \nPart 3: The flow of a viscous fluid inside a closed container was observed as its lid moved in a lateral direction. The flow of fluid in and out of a diverging channel was observed. The flow of fluid over an airfoil was observed.\nKey takeaways from these projects were grid generation, discretizing geometry, applying boundary conditions, numerical advancement of solution, and plotting of results using Tecplot software.

The objective of my research was studying the behavior of the combustion flame when subjected to swirling and parallel air coflow. Also of interest were spray parameters, namely droplet size distributions and spray cone angle.\n\nThe spray cone angle was determined using a high speed camera (3000 fps) and edge detection of collated image using MatLAB's image processing feature. The droplet size distributions were obtained by using a laser based particle size analyzer (Malvern Spraytec). The multi-phase flow was simulated using ANSYS Fluent. Combustion of liquid diesel spray was also simulated using Fluent's Species and Discrete Phase Models.\n\nI constructed a combustion chamber made of quartz glass and photographed the fuel flame using a DSLR camera. I used optical filters to study low frame rate images of the flames and compared their characteristics under varying input flow conditions. This project helped me learn the practical aspects of combustion fluid dynamics and chemistry. Now I have a better understanding of using optical instruments in combustion study.",
