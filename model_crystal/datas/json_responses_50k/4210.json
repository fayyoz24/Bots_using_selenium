Using the transwell system I created I model consisting out of physiologically relevant hydrogels (collagen and fibrinogen) in concentrations mimicking the progression of liver cancer from fibrosis to cirrhosis. While the model also incorporates three physiologically relevant cell lines; human endothelial cells, and HCC cells co-cultured with stellate cells. This system was developed as a modular system allowing the incorporation of other relevant immune cell types.  This model serves as a valuable tool in predicting not only relevant responses to chemotherapeutic drugs but also predicts the occurrence of  epithelial to mesenchymal transitions and metastatic potential of HCC.",
