Although I gained most of my experience at Prospect Business Consulting, a much smaller business than Manchester Metropolitan University, I was able to transfer my skills over to my new workload, which included working collaboratively with an experienced admin team, contributing to and leading administration projects including senior staff schedule management, conference administration and facilitation, timetabling and scheduling of the University's conference and meeting rooms, publishing and editing marketing materials and taking minutes of senior staff meetings. A particular challenge I faced was being given the task of creating and updating a database of hundreds of mobile phone contracts paid for by the university, which enabled me to develop my communications, data-management and co-ordination skills.",

I also taught adults in 1:1 and group classes. I worked and took training in the areas of General English, English for Specific Purposes and Business English as well as providing training for the most common English language examinations (Cambridge First Exam, TOEFL and IELTS amongst others). I am time flexible and I have successfully taught learners of various ages, backgrounds and profiles.",
