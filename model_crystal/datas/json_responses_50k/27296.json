    "summary": "You excel at thinking & doing and achieving results. And yet, you don\u2019t feel fulfilled and miss a clear vision. Here\u2019s why: you need your intuition to know what really matters to you. And your imagination to see all that could be. Without these powerful companions you may end up living a life that\u2019s not really yours. Or we inadvertently create a world together that none really wants to live in.\n\nSo, do you want to: \n-\tstop doing things on autopilot, just because that\u2019s how it has always been\n-\tbe more creative with the resources and constraints at hand\n-\texperience more clarity and joy with where you want to go\nbut you are not sure how?\n\nThen I\u2019m your imaginary friend! \n\nI coach bold individuals who want to follow their inner compass more, both inside and outside organisations. And I host eye-opening workshops that invite people to remove the goggles of habit. Seeing, thinking, acting and connecting in new ways and reimagining what is possible. \n\nNeuroscience shows that both our brains and bodies determine the options we see and the actions we take. So, to get you truly going, I help you harness your full intelligence, both cognitive \u00e1nd somatic \u2013 literally moving beyond blockages by sensing what you really want and tackling behavioral blind spots that get in your way.\n\nWHY ME?\nI've always been in the business of opening eyes and questioning assumptions. As the leader of a physics research group I used logic, intuition and imagination to make groundbreaking discoveries that have been published by the most prestigious science journals. And as a data journalist I created award-winning visual stories that reveal impactful new perspectives. \n\nOn a personal level, I use my intuition and imagination to find my way in challenging times. And through my polymer clay art and dance improvisation I've learned to tap even more into my embodied knowing and creative thinking skills.\n\nTo help you do you with more intuition & imagination too I have been certified as a co-active coach and I've developed my facilitation skills through two years of practice with the NeverDoneBefore  community, designing and hosting eye-opening workshops for intimate settings and for large events. I work both online and in person, in English and in Dutch.\n\nNOW WHAT?\nAlbert Einstein once said: Logic will get you from A to B \u2013 imagination will take you everywhere. Now add some intuition to that mix and you have a very powerful potion (trust me, I have a MSc in Chemistry). \n\nHow do you use that? What sparks your imagination? And how can I help you?\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to connecting with you!",
