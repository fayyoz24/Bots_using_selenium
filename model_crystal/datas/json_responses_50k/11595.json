Graduated in business economy, trained in gestalt psychology, schooled in business-related-neuroscience. If you seek a coach for yourself, your team, your organisation and the coach as a person is critical to the success, then consider Arri Pauw as your coach. \n\nArri has over 35 years of experience and perspective on delivering results in international businesses and institutions (universities). Included in the experience are 10 years as HR-director with Philips and Unilever. For over 25 years now, Arri operates as coach-consultant: guiding individual, team and organizational transformations. He worked with some 75 different businesses, developing over 250 teams and coached executives individually in over 2.000 sessions. \n\n\u201cOver the 35 years that I have been working across national and international businesses and institutions, it has become very clear to me that the biggest challenge for leaders is not what they want to do, but how to get it done. Most leaders answer this question by defining the budgets, by allocating the resources, by updating the structures and redefining the business processes. Of course, they inform their people and set targets for the execution. Only few leaders master the art of what I see to be the biggest challenge for a leader: how do I mobilise ownership and commitment with all my people behind a shared vision and for its implementation.'\n\nOctober 2020 his book 'Freedom in a Framework' will be published. By others described as a treasure trove of insights, real-life case studies and methods - all pragmatic and direct applicable.",
