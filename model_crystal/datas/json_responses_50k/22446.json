    "summary": "Hello and thank you for taking the time to view my profile. My name is Giorgos and I recently started working as a Manufacturing and Equipement Engineer at ASML.\n\nAfter finishing high school in Chalkis, my hometown, I decided to pursue a carreer in engineering, starting my studies in Techical University of Crete (TUC). I studied \"Production Engineering and Management\" a 5-year Engineering Diploma, following courses of Industrial and Mechanical Engineering.  During my 6 years in Chania I learned a lot, gained priceless experiences and a few friends along the way. TUC convinced me to dedicate my carrer in Industrial Engineering, the science which bring all engineering sciences together, making companies, people and the whole world better, one step at a time.\n\nAfter finishing my studies at Chania and my mandatory tenure in the Greek Army, I wanted to obtain deeper knowledge in the field of Industrial Engineering and live the experience of studying abroad. Thus, I continued my journey to Eindhoven following the Msc program \"Operations management and Logistics\". My experiences in the university, the country and its people made me pursue a job in the Netherlands, in, what I consider to be, a challenging and interesting business environment.\n\nAs a person, I am social and I like to meet new people and learn new things. I also like to go out with my friends for a beer or two, watching and playing basketball. In the cold winter nights that I have to stay home, I enjoy cooking seeing a movie or series or playing an online game.\n\nThanks again for your time and feel free to contact me.",
