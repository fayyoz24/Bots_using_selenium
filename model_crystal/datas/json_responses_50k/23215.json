    "summary": "I have been a student intern at NIE Times of India in Bangalore, where I received an overview on the Times Group functions along with other students in the city. I have volunteered with Proud Indian through participation in events, writing articles during the Covid-19 pandemic, and creating digital posters for their campaigns. I have also done crowdfunding with Alpha Urbane Project for Habitat for Humanity India, providing essential kits and hygiene kits to those affected by Covid-19 in India (2020). \n\nI have participated in several MUNs, like the Iris MUN and Twilight Conferences (2020) as a reporter of the international press, being awarded best reporter twice. I studied French for 6 years and made it to the national level of the Concours Romain Rolland French Olympiad thrice. I also have certificates from Michigan State University in \"Journalism, the future and you\" and Yale University in \"Moral Foundations of Politics\" online. \n\nI am currently an intern at Global Human Rights Defence, a part of their UN and fundraising team. I am also a student mentor who helps guide first year students in BA International Studies at Leiden University. \n\nI speak English, Marathi, Kannada and Hindi, while having academic proficiency in French and Arabic.",
