I designed a policy-oriented project to study the governance of climate change migrations in India. The rationale was to develop an extensive understanding of national and sub-national perception and response towards climate migration in a plural society which exhibits patterns of both internal and external migrations. And these migrations fluidly move from the spectrum of forced displacement to voluntary relocations. \nI spent 4 months in the field conducting in-depth interviews with senior governmental officials, semi-structured interviews with the street-level actors and group discussions at multiple locations in Assam for qualitative data collection.\nApproximately eight months were spent in the collection, cleaning and analysis of 9 data sets, making cross-data comparisons and sampling them against geographical vulnerability using very basic geospatial analytical capacity. \nBased on my observation I provided confidential expert consultation to the State government by highlighting geographical pockets in eight districts requiring urgent policy intervention. I also provided an overview of protection gaps in existing welfare programs arising mainly due to bureaucratic redundancy and duplicity of action.  \nThrough the analysis of highly confidential 'doubtful voter-data' and confidential information received during qualitative interviews, I identified the nested vulnerability based on gender and linguistic identity.\nThe doctoral dissertation resulting from this period of research engagement was successfully defended on 22nd February 2018",
