    "summary": "I love working with people, and I love learning new things. My education and career have pulled me in many different directions, first I fell in love with biochemistry, then I became passionate about communicating my love of biochemistry to all different kinds of people, and now I love helping people from all walks of life learn about whatever they're passionate about.\n\nWhile I may no longer study cells in the laboratory, I have kept each of my passions close and am motivated to continue doing so. I write the monthly chemistry column for Herbology News. I tutor pupils in Biology and Chemistry. I support students at Edinburgh college so they can get the most out of their education. I am even writing a children's book about our immune system that will *someday* be finished. \n\nMy aim is to weave each of these passions together to create a space where anyone can access the wonderful world of science and feel supported in their pursuit of lifelong learning. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, opportunities or just to say hello; I'd love to connect!",
