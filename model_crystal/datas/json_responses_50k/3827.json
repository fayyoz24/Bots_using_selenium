            "description": "Background\nThe use of solar panels in the built environment is on the rise. Due to the fluctuating supply of solar energy, and because the use of new electrical technologies (e.g. electric driving, induction cooking and heat pumps) will result in extra-large consumption on the low-voltage grid in the coming decade, the distribution and timing of electricity supply will be a major challenge. Local storage of electricity can play a major role in this.\n\nA consortium led by AquaBattery recently built a pilot installation of the Blue Battery at The Green Village in Delft, which stores sustainable electricity in fresh and salt water. This project was funded by a TKI Urban Energy subsidy project (TEUE116250), contributions from grid operators (Alliander and Enexis) and own financing. This battery has been used successfully and is now connected to the electricity grid. In addition, TU Delft has tested at the same location with a hydrogen car that can function as an electricity source (Car as a Power plant). Both techniques have the potential to balance electricity consumption and generation locally.\n\nObjective\nMix of consumers and producers makes it important to think about when something is switched on or off. For example, with extra electricity consumption, both the Blue Battery and the Hydrogen car can supply energy. With the growing number of different users of The Green Village, there is an excellent basis to analyze the modern consumption and generation patterns and to test the practical use of energy balancing. It will be investigated whether the advantages of microgrids (less investment in thick cabling, simple & smart energy management) outweighs the use of additional energy balancing in the form of a Blue Battery and Hydrogen car. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an efficient integration, implementation and validation of different local electricity sources, consumers and storage methods.\n\n",

This technology, referred to as \u201cBlue Acid/Base Battery\u201d (BAoBaB), stores electrical energy using pH and salinity differences in water. The principle of BAoBaB is altering the acid-base balance by means an excess of available electricity to obtain an acid and base from its corresponding salt. When electricity is needed, acid and base are recombined into their corresponding salt again while obtaining electrical work from the entropy and enthalpy gain. The energy density stored in such osmotic and pH-gradients outcompetes, by an order of magnitude, pumped hydropower, which is currently the leading technology for large scale electrical energy storage. In combination with the wide applicability (no geographical limitations) and scalability (operational in a range of kW-kWh up to MW-MWh), this innovative technology is attractive for stationary electrical energy storage. It is safer and more sustainable than other battery technologies as it does neither contain toxic chemicals nor scarce elements.\nOur goal is to develop this next generation storage technology from \u2018proof of concept\u2019 (TRL3) to \u2018validated in relevant environment\u2019 (TRL5).
