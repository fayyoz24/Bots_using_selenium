This included articles and research on air quality as well as cooperation with the Polish Smog Alert (Polski Alarm Smogowy) on placing an air quality measuring station in one of the schools. I also actively support the Association in organisational and promotional matters, e.g. taking pictures on events, being present on stands during open meetings or distributing leaflets in the neighbourhood."
