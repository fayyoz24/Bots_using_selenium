    "summary": "I am an open-minded, fast-learning, hard-working and purposeful person. I have a valuable experience of working in a dance industry. It includes teaching, choreographing, stage performing and shooting in music videos. Besides that I've obtained the Bachelor degree in International Communications at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine. After the russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, I had to move abroad, so I've resided in Rotterdam, the Netherlands for 1,5 years. I've experience different types of jobs there: a Dance Teacher, a Kitchen Assistant, a Bartender and a Waitress. Besides that dancing has been remaining as my main passion, so I was saving most of the earnings for different opportunities of dance education. \n    At the end of August I've moved to Copenhagen, Denmark for a dance study at Copenhagen Dance Education. I've got daily classes on Mon-Fri from 9am till 3pm, that's why I would prefer to work in the evenings and on weekends (fully available). Currently I am interested to work in a field that is more connected to my educational background, in the field of Communications and Media. I am open to new work experiences and new responsibilities. I am eager to learn fast. I might have no previous experience in specific positions or skills, but what I do have is a big desire to master the profession.",
