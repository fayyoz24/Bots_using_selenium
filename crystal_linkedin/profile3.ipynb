      "The best care for the patient! That is my ambition and also the common theme in my career. As infectious diseases physician I’m conducting translational research in the area of HIV and viral hepatitis. Both my own PhD project and those of my PhD students, take a clinical question as starting point. From there laboratory and epidemiological support aids in solving our research question aiming to improve patient care.Through participation in training of junior doctors and fellows’ infectious diseases, I strive to educate the best doctors for patients. Besides transfer of knowledge, I find it inspiring to see young doctors grow both in their personal and medical lives. The current technological possibilities of E-health applications increase patient participation. By being at the forefront of these innovations (video-consulting, mobile app development, blockchain technology) and looking for new possibilities and options, I participate in renewal and further development of our healthcare system.The best care for the patient!

      "I am a campaigner, human rights specialist, and former academic with a broad interest in the world around me. Within the Clean Clothes Campaign network I fight for labour rights for and with garment workers and their unions. Before that I used to research human rights, peace, and solidarity in a Cold War and post-Cold War context, for which I used to travel to Poland and Germany and developed a strong network in and knowledge of those countries. Beyond that I support the struggle for human rights in Belarus and Ukraine through my voluntary work for Libereco. After studying history in Utrecht, Siena and Berlin I spent a year of volunteering for the organisations Press Now in Hilversum and the academic cultural centre of the University of Gdansk in Poland. Shortly afterwards I started my PhD research at the Institute for German Studies in Amsterdam. I always strived to combine my most important fields of interest: human rights, Central and Eastern Europe, migration, and sustainability. This I managed by volunteering for Amnesty International, Greenpeace, refugee organisations and the Youth Copenhagen Coalition beside my PhD research on Dutch and West-German leftwing organisations and the Polish opposition in the 1980s. After finishing my PhD I made the connection even closer by starting a follow-up research on Amnesty International and Poland and starting as campaign and outreach coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign. In 2022, I spent five months volunteering at migrant rights and support organisations at the US-Mexican border. In my work I am enthusiastic and disciplined at the same time. From my academic career I take a propensity to be critical and analytical. As a campaigner I bring positive energy, creative thinking, and an ability to combine varying tasks. I am experienced in volunteer management, editing, communication, campaigning, lecturing, organising and research.I am a campaigner, human rights specialist, and former academic with a broad interest in the world around me.
