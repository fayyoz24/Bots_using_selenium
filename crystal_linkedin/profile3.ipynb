      "I’m an architect with almost 12 years of experience gathered working in renowned architecture practices in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. I have been currently working at TconcepT as a design architect for 6 years now and most recently I’ve been involved in masterplan projects, residential and retail-based large-scale projects located in Europe, Middle-East, and Russia.Committed, detail oriented and creative, I’m an architect interested in all aspects of master planning and architectural design. From the early strategic thinking to the technical design and the delivery of buildings on site, I have quite a diverse experience through different phases of a project, especially concept design, schematic design and also 3D visualization. When given ownership of a project, I swiftly outline a work plan, set key project deliverables, align my work to given budget and time, and move forward along with my team members to achieve the best results. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a variety of international challenging large scale projects, with rewarding feedback from clients, superiors, and peers.In Istanbul, I was a part of over 10 large scale masterplan projects (varies from 100K to 420K sqm) and I coordinated the external engineering and consultant teams, focusing on the masterplan and façade design. I developed retail-based urban densification projects, providing new residential and office building on top of retail schemes to meet inner-city needed in Sheffield, London, Belfast, and Stockholm. I managed to produce more than 300 in-house renderings, meanwhile working on various mixed-use schemes not only in Den Haag, Rotterdam and, Amsterdam but in Dubai, Duqm, and Moscow.My vast understanding of diverse cultures in different countries, coupled with my strong capacity for design thinking and execution of it, internal and external communications, and project management, make me a great fit for your team.I’m an architect with almost 12 years of experience gathered working in renowned architecture practices in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.

I have been currently working at TconcepT as a design architect for 6 years now and most recently I’ve been involved in masterplan projects, residential and retail-based large-scale projects located in Europe, Middle-East, and Russia.Committed, detail oriented and creative, I’m an architect interested in all aspects of master planning and architectural design. From the early strategic thinking to the technical design and the delivery of buildings on site, I have quite a diverse experience through different phases of a project, especially concept design, schematic design and also 3D visualization. When given ownership of a project, I swiftly outline a work plan, set key project deliverables, align my work to given budget and time, and move forward along with my team members to achieve the best results. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a variety of international challenging large scale projects, with rewarding feedback from clients, superiors, and peers.In Istanbul, I was a part of over 10 large scale masterplan projects (varies from 100K to 420K sqm) and I coordinated the external engineering and consultant teams, focusing on the masterplan and façade design. I developed retail-based urban densification projects, providing new residential and office building on top of retail schemes to meet inner-city needed in Sheffield, London, Belfast, and Stockholm. I managed to produce more than 300 in-house renderings, meanwhile working on various mixed-use schemes not only in Den Haag, Rotterdam and, Amsterdam but in Dubai, Duqm, and Moscow.My vast understanding of diverse cultures in different countries, coupled with my strong capacity for design thinking and execution of it, internal and external communications, and project management, make me a great fit for your team.I’m an architect with almost 12 years of experience gathered working in renowned architecture practices in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.
