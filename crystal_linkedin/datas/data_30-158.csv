In collaboration, the best therapeutic approach is tailored to your needs; client-focused.Member of the Dutch Institute for Psychologists (NIP)-238283I am a Nigerian who has lived most of her life traveling and living in various countries. Before moving to the Netherlands, which I now call home, I lived in Nigeria, Senegal, India, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

I carried out research on the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on psychological health. I also completed my thesis on exploring the relationship between resilience and ACEs among Nigerian adults. This has allowed me to understand the importance of childhood experiences and being trauma-informed which allows me to adapt and find ways of working and helping my clients.

After several years of combining research with teaching I made the decision to focus more fully on teaching.As a result I am currently employed as senior lecturer for the department of Radiology, teaching medicine and biomedical sciences students and for the department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Therapy, teaching pharmacy students.Having studied Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences at Leiden University (2005-2011) and specializing in neuroscience and pharmacology, I obtained a PhD investigating learning and behavioral problems in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy taking structural, metabolic and functional aspects of the brain into account (June 2017).

As post-doctoral researcher and subsequent senior researcher I continued this line of research by moving to Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne for 50% of the time over the course of 3.5 years. Upon completion of this joint endeavor I returned to the LUMC in full, but changed my focus to include a large teaching portfolio. After several years of combining research with teaching I made the decision to focus more fully on teaching.

As a result I am currently employed as senior lecturer for the department of Radiology, teaching medicine and biomedical sciences students and for the department of Clinical Pharmaceutical Therapy, teaching pharmacy students.
