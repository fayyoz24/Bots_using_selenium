Using qualitative and quantitative methods, we found that being tolerated, while it is an improvement upon facing outright rejection, is not as good as being fully accepted. In my years of serving marginalized communities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, I have delivered quality, bespoke workshops on mental health, consent, relationships, LGBT rights and allyship. My proudest achievement is having created Spoons, a thriving biweekly support group for multiply-marginalized people, in which I act as organizer, facilitator, and trainer. I am open to work as a mental health and diversity coach, minority advocate, workshop leader, and speaker/writer.
