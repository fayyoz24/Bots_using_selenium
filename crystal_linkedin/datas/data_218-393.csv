I am ready to focus on a new challenge, following up on the goals I have already achieved in my life.  For example, as a teenager I devoted my time to pole vaulting, where I continuously challenged myself to jump higher. By training full-time and competing on an international level I managed to jump, among others, to nine Dutch titles and two Dutch all-time records. Subsequently I dived deep into university life, where I constantly searched for extracurricular challenges to develop myself in various areas while strengthening a broad range of skills. I managed to excel by completing one Bachelor and two Masters Cum Laude, three fruitful internships (at Harvard University, in Rio de Janeiro and at an analytical consulting company), a successful board year, an elected position in the university council and many more interesting projects.

Upon return to my home country the Netherlands, I started my International Business course accordingly.In the second year of my bachelor, I got the opportunity to do a minor in Business & Culture in Taipei, Taiwan. Here, I I broadened my horizons even further with a fifth language: Mandarin Chinese. My goal is to become fluent in this language in two years (so, the deadline is 2023 😉)Next to cultures and languages, I have a great interest in people. Having had many sales jobs, I learned that I am a natural listener and a confident presenter. In addition, with my part-time job at the hotel software company The Hotels Network, I developed my marketing knowledge and analytical skills, further developing my skill set from my minor in International Marketing.Growing up in a multicultural family, my interest in cultures, languages, and people was sparked at a young age. At high school (gymnasium), I developed my language skills for French (B1), Spanish (B1), and English (C2). At 17-years old, I travelled to Asia and Australia by myself to volunteer, work, and learn about new cultures. While working for a sales company in Sydney, I discovered my interest in sales and marketing. Upon return to my home country the Netherlands, I started my International Business course accordingly.

My background in constructing multidisciplinary consortiums (at OMA/AMO, architecture/urban design), contract negotiations (between Dutch and MENA based companies), as well as catalysing public-private coalitions for social impact (Coalitions for Impact) have equipped me with an unique array of knowledge and competencies to successfully take any multilayered stakeholder impasse to a next level.Passionate about empowering a new generation of feminine leadership, through identity empowerment and ancestral wisdom. A firm believer that solutions to the challenges that many individuals, organisations and societies are facing today can be found in ancient tribal wisdom. A life-long learner and researcher, always reading a least 2 books at a time and perpetually getting lost in research articles.
I am also an intercultural, strategic connector with a passion for identifying unforeseen synergies.
50% Dutch 50% Persian. 100% proud solo mother of 3 teenage sons.
Fluent in Dutch, English, Farsi, Spanish and impact diplomacy. On a conversational level: Arabic, French and German….

As a certified executive mentor, I work with women of colour, on the intersection of cultural identity, professional leadership and personal development through the nush:u mentorship programme. Acting as an external sounding board for professional women of colour, empowering them to unlock their full potential, reaching their aspired roles as their authentic selves, not despite of their multi-faceted identities but because of their multi-faceted identity and unique origin story.

As co-founder of the human-innovation design collective Asei-Salehi I work together with Steven Asei-Dantoni Nkué on re-imagining systems and constructs within organisations through human innovation and corporate anthropology. Putting humanity at the core of business to improve employee wellbeing, team cohesion, retention and performance.

As a keynote speaker and guest lecturer I cover topics such as feminine leadership, identity empowerment and corporate anthropology. On request, I share my vision on D, E & I from a design thinking perspective.
As a moderator I facilitate symposiums as well as complex stakeholder dialogue sessions. My background in constructing multidisciplinary consortiums (at OMA/AMO, architecture/urban design), contract negotiations (between Dutch and MENA based companies), as well as catalysing public-private coalitions for social impact (Coalitions for Impact) have equipped me with an unique array of knowledge and competencies to successfully take any multilayered stakeholder impasse to a next level.
