My experience in market, liquidity, and credit risk management has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of risk management and the regulatory landscape.

I hold a Master of Science in Business Administration with a focus on International Management from the University of Amsterdam, and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance, Banking, and Insurance from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These degrees, combined with my professional experience, have provided me with a solid theoretical background and practical skills that I can apply to any role in the financial services industry.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated an ambitious, conscientious, and resilient approach to my work, and I am always eager to learn and confront new challenges. I have a passion for international business and a desire to explore different cultures and communicate with people from diverse backgrounds.

As a native Bulgarian, I am fluent in English and German, and I have a great interest in finance, management, and international business. I am particularly drawn to the areas of financial risk management where I can further develop my skills and contribute to the success of any organization.

I am confident that my experience, skills, and passion make me a valuable asset to any team, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities in the financial risk management area.
